Challenges for Defining the Role of MAOB in Parkinson's Disease\n\nPD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative motor disorder, which is caused by nigrostriatal DA depletion [23]. It is characterized by remarkable motor dysfunction, including bradykinesia, resting tremor, gait disturbance, and postural instability [24]. Apart from levodopa, which is the most popular therapeutic agent for PD, several irreversible MAOB inhibitors have been widely prescribed for PD patients as an early monotherapy or an add-on to other medications, despite some reports demonstrating their discouraging clinical effects [25,26].\n\nThere are two isoenzymes of MAO: MAOA and MAOB. While both isoenzymes are mitochondria-bound flavoenzymes [27], their physiological and pathological roles are distinct due to their differential cellular localization [28] and distinct substrate selectivity. First, MAOA is mainly localized in the nigrostriatal DAergic axon terminals [28,29,30], whereas MAOB is located exclusively in astrocytes and serotonergic neurons [29,30]. Second, they have distinct molecular differences in enzymatic properties revealed by cDNA cloning and peptide sequencing of human MAOA and MAOB [31,32], allowing their differential substrate selectivity. In particular, MAOA is primarily responsible for the metabolism of epinephrine, norepinephrine, melatonin, and serotonin, whereas MAOB is responsible for the degradation of phenylethylamine and benzylamine [33]. Notably, DA is traditionally known to be degraded by both MAOA and MAOB. Particularly, MAOB is known to be upregulated in PD patients' brains [34]. Therefore, MAOB has long been believed to contribute to PD pathophysiology through excessive DA degradation [35]. This belief was further supported by a positive but limited clinical efficacy of irreversible MAOB inhibitors such as selegiline and rasagiline for PD patients [36,37].\n\nSince 2014, several investigations have begun to emphasize the specific involvement of MAOB, but not MAOA, in astrocytic GABA production via the putrescine degradation route [15,16,21,38,39,40], which has been overlooked in the brain for decades. Moreover, MAOB has recently received special attention due to its increased level along with reactive astrogliosis in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [15,16,17,18,21,22,38,41]. These recent discoveries on the pathological role of astrocytic MAOB led us to revisit the MAOB's role in PD pathophysiology. The therapeutic efficacy of MAOB inhibitors for PD is not attributed to a blockade of DA degradation. Instead, it is attributed to a blockade of the excessive astrocytic GABA synthesis and the aberrant tonic inhibition of DAergic neurons in the SNpc. In this review, we summarize the traditional views and recent perspectives in an attempt to redefine the pathological role of MAOB in PD pathophysiology.\n\n2.1. Traditional Views on MAOB as a DA-Metabolizing Enzyme\n\nAs described above, MAOA and MAOB have differential substrate selectivity. In particular, epinephrine, norepinephrine, melatonin, and serotonin are known to be metabolized by MAOA, whereas phenylethylamine and benzylamine are known to be degraded by MAOB [33]. Among several various monoamines, DA has been one of the most well-known substrates for MAO for the past six decades ago [42]. Since the first-generation specific inhibitors of MAOA and MAOB, clorgiline, and selegiline, respectively, were developed in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate which isoenzyme was responsible for DA metabolism in the 1970s. Several in vivo studies with selective inhibitors against MAOA and MAOB demonstrated that DA is much preferentially degraded by MAOA compared to MAOB in the rat brain [43,44]. On the other hand, some other studies using selegiline also demonstrated that MAOB catalyzes DA as a substrate in rats [45,46,47]. These conflicting results could be partially attributed to the low selectivity of selegiline to MAOB over MAOA (~150-fold difference). Indeed, the affinity of DA deamination was 2.5-fold higher to MAOA than MAOB [47]. Notably, an investigation with the homogenates of brain tissues from various species by Garrick and Murphy demonstrated that DA was found to be deaminated largely by MAOA in the rat brains, whereas by MAOB in the brains of humans and vervet [46]. However, this pivotal finding was limited by the fact that the enzymatic activities of MAOA and MAOB were measured with tissue homogenates which could be different from the intact brain. Despite the controversies on the contributions of MAOA and MAOB to DA degradation, it has been traditionally and until now generally believed that both MAOA and MAOB are equally active towards DA degradation [35,48,49,50,51].\n",

This aberrant GABA synthesis disrupts neuronal signaling and induces cellular stress, which may trigger the upregulation of STC2 as part of a compensatory neuroprotective response. This hypothesis builds on existing evidence of MAO-B's role in astrocytic activity and STC2's involvement in stress responses, while proposing a novel intermediary mechanism involving GABA-mediated stress signaling.",

Measure STC2 expression levels using qPCR and Western blot, and include controls such as non-neurodegenerative models and astrocytes without MAO-B manipulation. Additionally, assess the role of astrocytic GABA by using GABA synthesis inhibitors to determine if STC2 expression changes are mediated through this pathway.",

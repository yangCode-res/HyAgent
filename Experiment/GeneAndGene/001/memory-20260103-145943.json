Introduction\n\nAcute lung injury (ALI) or its more severe clinical manifestation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is an acute inflammatory lung disease that leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality annually $^{1-3}$ . Recently, ARDS has been divided into mild, moderate, and severe by the Berlin definition according to the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, and therefore excluded the term ALI, since it is analogous to mild ARDS $^{4}$ . ALI/ARDS originates from a wide variety of direct (pulmonary) lung injuries such as pneumonia, or indirect (extrapulmonary) insults such as sepsis (Table 1) $^{5-7}$ . Regardless of the differences between the pulmonary and extrapulmonary forms of ALI/ARDS, the terminal pathophysiological characteristics are remarkably similar, including dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary membrane, enhanced inflammation, and decreased alveolar fluid clearance, resulting in pulmonary edema, impaired gas exchange, and hypoxemia $^{8-10}$ .",

        "text": "Despite the extensive studies and the multiple possible targets of ALI/ARDS, there are still no specific pharmacological treatments. To date, the best practice against ALI/ARDS remains protective ventilation, including low tidal volumes and high positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) levels[11,12]. Nevertheless, the mortality remains unchanged at approximately  $40\\%$ , besides the long-term use of mechanical ventilation can aggravate lung damage [ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI)] or even cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)[8,10,13,14]. Prone position ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used in the short term to manage patients with severe hypoxemia. Also, adjuvant therapies such as exogenous surfactants, inhaled nitric oxide may improve arterial oxygenation. However, none of these supportive therapies can reduce inflammation in the lungs nor have been efficiently demonstrated to move forward the overall clinical outcomes of ALI/ARDS[1,15]. Steroid anti-inflammatory drugs were supposed to reduce the associated pulmonary inflammation, though their efficacy in ALI/ARDS is debated and the clinical outcomes are\n\ncontroversial $^{16,17}$ . Accordingly, ALI/ARDS represents an unmet medical need that requires innovative therapeutic strategies to decrease mortalities by treating the underlying molecular mechanisms besides the supportive treatment. For instance, the blockade of signaling pathways that amplify the inflammation associated with this devastating disease may present an attractive approach to limit lung injury $^{18}$ . Gene silencing may present the best paradigm that can specifically and efficiently inhibit these mechanisms and open up new treatment opportunities for ALI/ARDS. Specifically, gene silencing via short-interfering RNA (siRNA) may be implemented to modify the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in ALI/ARDS at the mRNA level $^{19}$ . Interestingly, the design and the identification of a potent siRNA could be done more easily and rapidly as compared to conventional drug development $^{20}$ . Typically, siRNA can trigger one specific gene. By contrast, other RNA interference therapeutics such as microRNAs (miRNAs) bind imperfectly to mRNA and can degrade multiple mRNA targets, causing toxicity $^{21-24}$ . Further, siRNA can be easily synthesized, does not require genome integration, and thereby avoids the gene therapy-related risks of mutation and teratogenicity $^{25}$ , in contrast to other gene therapies, such as the plasmid-based short RNAs (shRNA) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) Besides, siRNA has a small size, higher transfection efficacy, potency and specificity, fewer obstacles, and lower immune response, making them the best fit for RNAi therapeutics $^{22,23}$ .\n\nThe characteristics, including clear anatomy, accessibility, relative immune privilege, and relatively low enzyme activity, make the lung a good target for local siRNAs therapy[26]. Nevertheless, its translation into the clinic is hampered by an inefficient delivery to the target cells owing to several unfavorable physicochemical properties of naked siRNA. Thus, there have been significant efforts to design efficient vector systems to overcome the shortcomings in siRNA delivery and to develop stable siRNA formulations for pulmonary administration pushing forward towards the clinical availability of siRNA therapeutics for ALI/ARDS.\n\nTable 1 ALI/ARDS risk factors.\n\n|  Frequency | Direct (pulmonary) lung injury | Indirect (extrapulmonary) lung injury  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Common | Pneumonia | Non-pulmonary sepsis  |\n|   |  Aspiration of gastric contents | Major trauma  |\n|  Less common | Lung contusion | Transfusion of blood products  |\n|   |  Inhalation of toxic gases (NO2, ammonia, phosgene) | Acute pancreatitis  |\n|   |  Near drowning | Hemorrhagic shock or reperfusion injury  |\n|   |  Embolism (fat embolism, amniotic fluid embolism) | Drug overdose (narcotics, sedatives, aspirin, thiazides)  |\n|   |  Reperfusion edema following lung transplantation |   |\n\nIn this review, we will first introduce the pathophysiological mechanisms of ALI/ARDS as the first step to determine the possible targets for siRNA. The potential of siRNA therapeutic as a novel approach to combat ALI/ARDS is then emphasized. Then, we highlight the privileges of the pulmonary route for the treatment of ALI/ARDS and we discuss the different intracellular and extracellular barriers that siRNA or siRNA carriers have to overcome to reach their targets. Finally, the different delivery vectors that can be applied for siRNA pulmonary delivery in ALI/ARD are presented.\n\n## Pathogenesis of ALI\n\nALI/ARDS is divided into 3 phases: exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic. Initially, the injured lung goes by an acute/early or exudative phase characterized by damage of the alveolar barrier and pulmonary edema. Then, the exudative phase evolves into a proliferative or organizing phase after approximately 1--2 weeks to begin the process of lung repair, and finally, it may progress to an irreversible fibrotic phase in some patients7^{,}27, 28, 29, 30.\n\n### Exudative phase",

        "text": "This phase starts with the disruption of alveolar-capillary integrity by pulmonary or extrapulmonary injuries. Initially, resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) recognize nonendogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid, or endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as histones and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This leads to NF-κB-dependent polarization of AMs into M1-like macrophages, that release pro-inflammatory mediators and chemokines contributing to the excessive recruitment of neutrophils and monocytic cells30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. The aggregation of neutrophils within the pulmonary vasculature can also result from the complement activation and release of C5a7. In the lung, activated neutrophils release numerous cytotoxic substances, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), various proinflammatory cytokines, granular enzymes, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In ALI/ARDS, AMs and neutrophils are the primary sources of proinflammatory cytokines. Consequently, the balance between proinflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, TNF-α, and TGF-β) and anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10 and IL-13) is broken13^{,}30^{,}35^{,}38. This inflammatory dysfunction leads to the disruption of alveolar epithelium constituted of alveolar cells type (ATI), that cover the majority of the alveolar surface area playing a primary role in gas exchange and fluid reabsorption, as well as type II alveolar cells (ATII) playing a critical role in alveolar fluid clearance, the production of pulmonary surfactant, and the repopulation of the damaged ATI10^{,}39. The endothelial injury also contributes to the flooding of airspaces, but epithelium injury is more involved39. Eventually, the resultant increase of alveolar-capillary permeability, surfactant dysfunction, and decreased alveolar fluid clearance lead to pulmonary edema, impaired gas exchange, and hypoxemia10. Furthermore, the irreversible damage of ATI and the subsequent replacement of the denuded space by the deposition of proteins, fibrin, and cellular debris, contribute to the formation of hyaline membranes (Fig. 1A and B)29.\n\nAlveolar epithelial cell (EpiCs) death, either apoptotic or necrotic, is the most extreme form of alveolar barrier injury observed in ALI/ARDS, and one of the most important therapeutic targets for ALI/ARDS. Besides the inflammatory-induced epithelial injury, epithelial cell death can be directly caused by acid aspiration, hyperoxia, and physical forces13^{,}39. The disruption of the endothelial barrier leads to interstitial and alveolar immune cells infiltration and plasma extravasation, facilitated by the injury of alveolar epithelium increasing the pulmonary edema. Besides, the activation of endothelial cells (ECs) by stimuli such as hypoxia and inflammatory cytokines lead to their shift to prothrombotic, proinflammatory, and proadhesive phenotype promoting the procoagulant environment in ALI/ARDS (Fig. 2)10^{,}40.\n\n### Proliferative phase\n\nOverlapping with the exudative phase, the proliferative phase starts. In this phase, ATII cells proliferate and differentiate into ATI cells to replace injured and necrotic cells, leading to the reabsorption of alveolar edema and restoration of alveolar architecture and function7^{,}15^{,}27. Besides the epithelial integrity, endothelial integrity must also be restored, but this process is less well understood. Interestingly, it has been suggested that bronchoalveolar stem cells also have a role in this resolution41. Simultaneously, resolution of inflammation involves termination of pro-inflammatory signaling and clearance of apoptotic neutrophils41. AMs shift from M1 to M2 macrophages able to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. This results in a decrease of proinflammatory cytokines production and removal of neutrophils, necrotic cells, and debris from the alveolar space (Fig. 1C)34^{,}42. Also, it has been reported that T-regulatory lymphocytes may suppress cytokines production and neutrophil cell death contributing to the resolution of lung inflammation41^{,}42.\n\n### Fibrotic phase\n\nPulmonary fibrosis is a more frequent complication in ALI/ARDS of primary pulmonary origin28, which may start in parallel with the previous phases in some patients. It is marked by extensive basement membrane damage, persistent edema, loss of elastic tissue, and obliteration of alveolar spaces with a dense irregular matrix27^{,}34^{,}43. This is mainly due to the proliferation and accumulation of activated fibroblasts, secreting extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, predominantly the fibrillar collagen type I, but also type III collagen43, resulting in the development of interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis that may slowly resolve or cause irreversible lung destruction. The observed fibroblast activation may be regulated by growth factors such as TGF-β, coagulation cascade proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines44. This phase does not happen in all ALI/ARDS patients but has been associated with mechanical, biochemical, and histological evidences of fibrosis with a doubling of lung collagen, progressive hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and increased mortality (Fig. 1D)27^{,}34^{,}44.\n\n## siRNAs as promising therapeutics for ALI/ARDS\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that silences gene expression by promoting the degradation of mRNA24. RNAi mechanism was uncovered in Caenorhabditis elegans by Fire and Mello in 199845, but it was until 2006 when it gained momentum as they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine46. RNAi is a post-transcriptional gene regulation process wherein double-\n\nPulmonary delivery of siRNA for treatment of ALI/ARDS",

        "text": "stranded endogenous or exogenous noncoding RNA molecules, including small interfering RNAs (siRNA), microRNAs (miRNAs), short RNAs (shRNAs), or piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), induce silencing of homologous messenger RNA (mRNA) in a sequence-specific way[47]. Initially, the process starts by breaking down the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into smaller RNA duplexes, known as siRNA, by the enzyme Dicer. The resulting 21-23 nucleotide dsRNA, or the directly transfected synthetic siRNA, are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Subsequently, the endonuclease argonaute 2 (Ago-2) component of the RISC unwinds the duplex into two single-stranded RNAs, the \"passenger or sense\" that will be released, and the \"guide or antisense\" strand that will guide the complex RISC to the complementary target mRNA sequence. Finally, the complex cleaves the target mRNA, mediated by Ago-2, leading to inhibition of mRNA translation and the knockdown of the target gene[47-49].\n\nSynthetic siRNAs are directly delivered to the cytosol, however, the plasmid-based shRNAs need to cross the cellular membrane to penetrate the nucleus where they are transcribed before\n\nbeing exported to the cytosol to be processed into active siRNAs $^{47}$ , and has therefore attracted less attention as a pharmaceutical agent in gene therapy $^{50}$ . Typically, siRNA can trigger specific gene silencing since the antisense strand only binds to mRNA that is perfectly complementary to it. By contrast, miRNA that has a stem-loop and whose biogenesis is initially started in the nucleus binds imperfectly to mRNA and can degrade multiple mRNA targets causing toxicity $^{21-24}$ . Accordingly, RNAi therapy has unlimited choices of targets and it is possible to design effective RNAi drug targeting for any disease-promoting gene according to the mRNA sequence $^{25,51}$ . siRNA is more favorable for therapeutic use over other gene therapies because it can be easily synthesized, does not require genome integration, and thereby avoids the gene therapy-related risks of mutation and teratogenicity $^{25}$ , with no problem of permanent modification since siRNA therapy can be stopped and controlled at any time and stage of treatment $^{52}$ . The delivery of siRNA is easier compared with shRNA plasmid or pDNA delivery since its site of action is the cytosol. Furthermore, siRNA has a small size, higher transfection efficacy, potency and specificity, fewer obstacles, and\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 1 Schematic illustration of normal alveolus (A), injured alveolus during the exudative (B), proliferative (C), and fibrotic (D) phases in ALI/ARDS.\n\nlower immune response, making them the best fit for RNAi therapeutics22^{,}23.\n\nSince the discovery of the Nobel prize-winning mechanism of RNAi fifteen years ago46, it has become a promising drug target for treating a myriad of diseases, including genetic diseases, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, cancer, and viral infection53. To date, three siRNA-based therapeutics are already in the pharmaceutical market. The first is ONPATTRO® (patisiran), a lipid nanoparticle administered intravenously once every 3 weeks, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2018, to treat hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). The second is GIVLAARI™ (givosiran) approved in the USA in November 2019 to treat acute hepatic porphyria. The third is Oxlumo™ (lumasiran) approved in November 2020 by the EU and FDA to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Both givosiran and lumasiran are administered subcutaneously as N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugates54^{,}55. Beyond the 3 siRNAs-based drugs already approved, there are another 7 in phase 3 trials. For instance, nedosiran is developed to treat primary hyperoxaluria, vutrisiran for the treatment of hATTR like patisiran, teprasiran for the prevention of acute kidney injury after transplant or cardiovascular surgery, fitusiran, for hemophilia A and B, tivanisiran to treat ocular pain and dry eye disease, and cosdosiran to treat nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Also, siRNA therapy was expanded from orphan and rare diseases to more prevalent conditions, such as inclisiran for hypercholesterolemia56. Most of these drug candidates are GalNAc conjugates, except teprasiran, cosdosiran, and tivanisiran, which were not delivered with a carrier or conjugated to a targeting ligand.\n\nNotably, siRNAs have been previously reported to be an effective nucleic acid-based therapy in respiratory diseases57, 58, 59, 60, including ALI/ARDS, by targeting the essential inflammatory pathways involved in this disease61^{,}62. Much work has been done to find potential therapeutic targets of ALI/ARDS, such as those involved in epithelial-endothelial dysfunction, immune cell recruitment, or fibroblast activation; to reinforce lung defense mechanisms and enhance lung repair process19^{,}63. Nevertheless, these studies need to be accompanied by simultaneous research about the best delivery strategies of siRNA therapy of ALI/ARDS to achieve rapid successful outcomes.\n\n## Pulmonary delivery of siRNA for treatment of ALI/ARDS: Advantages and barriers\n\n### Advantages of siRNA pulmonary delivery",

        "text": "The delivery of drugs to the lung can be achieved directly via the pulmonary route or indirectly by systemic administration. However, nucleic acids can be degraded by serum nucleases in the bloodstream, hurdling the systemic delivery for siRNA19. In contrast, the local administration of siRNAs offers several important benefits over systemic delivery, such as minimized undesirable systemic effects, as well as reduced dose of siRNAs due to the high bioavailability at the target site and the lower lung nuclease activity improving siRNA stability and efficacy (Fig. 3)20^{,}23^{,}58^{,}62^{,}64. Most importantly, the pulmonary route allows direct access to lung EpiCs, key target cells for gene knockdown in ALI/ARDS21.\n\nAlthough inhalation of siRNAs is clinically the most common and non-invasive method, the majority of in vivo studies were conducted intratracheally or intranasally due to their simplicity and ease of administration to animals compared to the inhalation formulations21^{,}58^{,}65. Clinically, intranasal instillations are easy to perform. However, the particles are vastly filtered out in the human nasal cavity. Similarly, intratracheal administration is relatively invasive and not suitable for human use57.\n\nIt has been reported that the most appropriate method for pulmonary administration of siRNA-based therapeutics is inhalation using pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), requiring aerosolization of the drug by suspension or dissolution in a propellant57. The two other inhalation devices, nebulizers and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are less common owing to the higher\n\nPulmonary delivery of siRNA for treatment of ALI/ARDS\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3 Pulmonary versus systemic delivery of siRNA to the lung.\n\nchance of siRNA degradation by the applied stress of nebulizers, and the difficulty to formulate siRNA-containing powders or preserving the integrity and bioactivity of siRNA, which hinders the use of DPIs $^{19}$ . However, the use of liquid formulations is not suitable for long-term storage. Accordingly, DPIs seem to be the more promising option because they are more stable, and have a lower risk of contamination extending their shelf-life $^{26,63,66-68}$ .\n\n# 4.2. Barriers of siRNA pulmonary delivery\n\nDespite all the advantages of siRNA pulmonary delivery over systemic delivery, it still faces several barriers. This includes extracellular barriers that can be anatomical, physiological, metabolic, and immunological due to the inherent properties of the lung as well as intracellular barriers, related to the cellular uptake and endosomal escape $^{69,70}$ , all with considering the disease pathological changes. Overcoming these barriers is indispensable to develop a successful inhalable siRNA against ALI/ARDS $^{61}$ .\n\n# 4.2.1. Extracellular barriers\n\nTo reach its target, siRNA needs first to overcome the undermentioned extracellular barriers.\n\n4.2.1.1. Anatomical barriers. The human respiratory tract includes 23 groups of branching airways. The first 16 generations from the nasal cavity to the bronchi constitute the region of the conducting airways responsible for the conduction of gases, and the next 17-23 generations extending from the bronchioles to alveoli compose the respiratory airways responsible for the gaseous exchange $^{71}$ . This branched structure of the airways with different diameters and lengths presents an initial hurdle that siRNA must pass along to reach the deep lung area $^{57,66}$ . Here, the site of deposition mainly depends on the size of particles. For deep penetration into the alveolar region, particles should have an optimal aerodynamic diameter between 1 and  $5\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ , smaller enough to not deposit in the upper airways and larger enough for not being exhaled during normal breathing $^{62,72}$ , with maximum deposition in alveoli region between 1 and  $2\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{73}$ . However,  $100\\mathrm{nm}$  particles have been stated to settle successfully into the alveolar space due to the Brownian diffusion mechanism $^{57,62,66,73}$ .\n\nTo avoid the exhalation of nanoparticles and improve their lung deposition, the \"Trojan microparticles\" or nanoparticles-in-microparticles, have been proposed to deliver them as dissociable microparticles having desired aerodynamic range  $(1 - 5\\mu \\mathrm{mol} / \\mathrm{L}$  in size) but can disassemble into nanoparticles upon lung deposition. Simultaneously, this strategy provides the aerodynamic behavior of microparticles and the ability of nanoparticles to avoid clearance[74,75]. Accordingly, a previous study conducted in a rodent model using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent NPs reported a negligible systemic absorption (less than  $5\\%$  after  $1\\textrm{h}$ ) of particles bigger than  $100\\mathrm{nm}$  after intratracheal administration. This study showed also that particles smaller than  $34\\mathrm{nm}$  were rapidly removed to the lymph and those smaller than  $6\\mathrm{nm}$  were quickly excreted in the urine[76]. These findings support the use of  $100 - 200\\mathrm{nm}$  as the optimal nanoscale for pulmonary route[74]. Typically, the extrapulmonary distribution of NPs is neglected in this nanoscale range. However, it may be enhanced by the loss of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity associated with ALI/ARDS[75].",

        "text": "4.2.1.2. Physiological and metabolic barriers. After lung deposition, the next hurdle for siRNA pulmonary delivery to overcome is the clearance of particles. Clearance mechanisms depend on the site of deposition in the lung. The particles are mainly removed by the mucociliary clearance in the conducting airways and the AMs in the respiratory region[75,77]. The continuous turnover of mucus, the mucociliary clearance driven by the physical action of the ciliated EpiCs, and the possible interactions (electrostatic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic) with particles, constitute a major pulmonary delivery barrier[72,78]. The interaction of pulmonary delivered particles with mucus and their mucociliary clearance are both surface and particle-size-dependent[75]. It was found that particles larger than  $500\\mathrm{nm}$  were sterically immobilized. In contrast,  $100 - 200\\mathrm{nm}$  diameter particles rapidly penetrated the mucus of human respiratory systems[79]. Also, positively charged particles will be more trapped in the mucus rich in anionic mucin glycoproteins than the negatively charged particles. Yet, the commonly utilized siRNA delivery vehicles are polycationic which may hurdle their penetration to the mucus barrier, and therefore their therapeutic efficacy[80]. In contrast, neutral particles\n\nexhibited higher average transport rates75. The hydrophilic and neutral surfaces can be achieved by coating particles with hydrophilic and neutrally charged polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), or charge reversible peptides. In addition to the glycosylated regions, the mucin peptides may also trap hydrophobic particulates (Fig. 4)72^{,}78, 79, 80, 81. Favorably, an enhanced mucoadhesion could prolong the lung retention time of pulmonary delivered particles, leading to an improved and pharmacokinetic profile75. The impaired mucociliary clearance in ALI/ARDS can further prolong this retention.\n\nBesides the respiratory mucus, the alveolar surface is covered by pulmonary surfactant (PS), a complex mixture of lipids and proteins82. PS can strongly interact with drugs hindering their effectiveness19^{,}57. Fortunately, this may not have a great impact on ALI/ARDS since surfactant production is disrupted. Formerly, PS has been considered as a siRNA delivery barrier to the respiratory target cells. Lately, a beneficial role of PS in local pulmonary siRNA delivery has been illustrated, hypothesizing that the lung surfactant proteins may act as an “endogenous” delivery vector82.\n\nOn the other hand, the ALI/ARDS-increased alveolar fluid can hamper the drug molecules from reaching the epithelium. Moreover, the possible interaction of the cationic siRNA complexes with the anionic constituents of alveolar liquid, including phospholipids and proteins, especially in protein-rich edema fluid in ALI/ARDS constitutes another barrier that can hinder their diffusion. Also, the consolidated or collapsed alveoli further hinder the transducing of acutely injured lungs. Likewise, an associated cough can increase the removal of siRNA from the airways19^{,}81. Despite the lower metabolic capacity of the lung and its negligible nuclease activity, naked siRNA or siRNA carriers may undergo enzymatic degradation following pulmonary delivery, mediated by enzymes such as antitrypsin and proteases61^{,}75.\n\n#### Immunological barriers\n\nsiRNA molecules deposited in the respiratory region are primarily cleared by AMs77, further accumulated in the airspace in ALI/ARDS, to be either degraded or removed to the lymphatic system74. It has been speculated that particles smaller than 150 nm can well escape AMs uptake72. Cationic particles can be bound to the anionic sialic acid present on the surface of AMs and thus preferentially phagocytosed compared with the negatively charged ones75. Similar to macrophages, neutrophils that are extensively recruited to the lungs in ALI/ARDS may contribute to siRNA clearance. Also, possible electrostatic interactions between siRNA delivery complexes and cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, and complement components, remarkably increased in the ALI/ARDS alveolar space, can hinder their effectiveness78.\n\n#### Therapeutic barriers\n\nMechanical ventilation (MV) largely impacts the aerosolization efficiency and deposition within the respiratory tracts of the pulmonary delivered siRNA/siRNA carriers83^{,}84. Harmfully, the presence of heat and humidity in the ventilator circuit can reduce the efficiency of drug delivery83. In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, it is difficult to ensure that the aerosolized particles are efficiently delivered to distal airways85. It has been reported that the aerosol generated by nebulizers in mechanically ventilated patients was mostly deposited in proximal airways with a lung deposition lower than 20% of the nominal dose84^{,}86. Thus, inhalation devices and administration procedures have to be improved for patients under MV84. Positively, the time required to deliver a specified amount of drug to its target and the proportion of drugs delivered could be better managed by controlling the ventilator settings (tidal volume, airflow, inspiratory time/total duration of the breath)83^{,}85.\n\n### Intracellular barriers\n\nAfter overcoming the aforementioned extracellular barriers, siRNA has to bypass a set of intracellular barriers to reach RNAi machinery in the cytoplasm.\n\n#### Cellular uptake\n\nThe anionic cell membrane is another barrier to siRNA delivery. Naked siRNA does not easily cross the cell membrane due to its negative charge and",

        "text": "high molecular weight87. Thus, effective delivery strategies may be used to facilitate siRNA cellular uptake. The major cell uptake pathway associated with the non-viral delivery of siRNA is endocytosis72. Generally, the cationic siRNA-carrier interacts with anionic proteoglycans and enters the cells by endocytosis88. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the best characterized and the most common route involved in the cellular uptake of siRNA during pulmonary delivery, particularly if the diameter is less than 200 nm61^{,}66. Particles under 150 nm can both avoid macrophage uptake and be efficiently endocytosed. Besides, caveolae-dependent endocytosis may also mediate siRNA cellular entry, especially for sizes greater than 500 nm66.\n\n#### Endosomal escape\n\nAfter cellular entry, the entrapped siRNA/siRNA-carrier vesicles are transported in early endosomes that mature into late endosomes (pH 5--6), and then into lysosomes (pH ~4.5) containing nucleases and other degradative enzymes. Thereby, siRNAs must escape into the cytosol (pH ~7.4) at an early stage to avoid lysosomal degradation86^{,}88. The endosomal escape is the rate-limiting step for efficient siRNA delivery88. Several strategies have been investigated to promote the endosomal escape, including the incorporation of polymers such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) due to their high buffering capacity causing an increased osmolarity and endosome disruption, fusogenic lipids such DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-l-α-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine) or pH-sensitive fusogenic peptides such as GALA (a repeat of glutamic acid-alanine-leucine-alanine, WEAALAEALAEALAEHLAEALAEALEALAA) owing to their ability to undergo conformational changes in low pH, causing a destabilization of endosomal membrane66^{,}70. Notably, it has been reported that even 0.1% endosomal escape in the cytosol of target cells may be enough for effective RNAi performance since siRNA can amplify itself within the cell88. For caveolae-mediated endocytosis, vectors are entrapped in nonacidic vesicles, transported to the Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum, and in that way escaping the lysosomal degradation66^{,}89.\n\n## siRNA delivery systems for treatment of ALI/ARDS\n\nAlthough the use of siRNAs seems to be a powerful approach against ALI/ARDS, its clinical application is still hurdled by many obstacles as discussed earlier. Similar to other nucleic acid-based therapeutics, this includes off-target effects, triggering of interferon responses, poor stability, and inefficient in vivo delivery, which have been the main challenge to applying siRNA-based therapeutics in humans20^{,}53^{,}88. The properties of suitable delivery systems for siRNAs as potential therapeutic agents include the ability to: (1) entrap siRNA into a stable particle, (2) effectively protect siRNA from enzymatic degradation, (3) avoid pulmonary extracellular barriers, (4) possess high transfection efficiency to facilitate its cellular uptake, (5) have good intracellular trafficking properties to promote the endosomal escape and the cytosolic release of siRNA. Also, an optimal siRNA delivery vector should be biodegradable, biocompatible, with negligible toxicity and immunogenicity, and should not cause inflammation. Also, it should be suitable for large-scale manufacturing (Fig. 5)72^{,}88^{,}90. Owing to the similarities between DNA and RNA, many vectors tested for DNA delivery have been explored for drug delivery of siRNA to the lung against ALI/ARDS (Table 2)91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\n### Viral vectors\n\nVirus-based delivery vectors, such as adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, lentiviruses, were used to introduce genetic material into host cells after removing their virulence genes and inserting engineered genes into their genomes101^{,}102.\n\n### Adenovirus\n\nAdenovirus (AV), a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus, was approved for clinical trials in 1990 as the first viral gene delivery vector101. Gendicine™, which is an AV-based system loaded with mutated p53 gene, was approved by the CFDA in 2003 for treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as the first-ever gene therapy103. AV is widely used in lung-targeted gene therapy104^{,}105. However, AV-mediated gene delivery is limited by AV-induced immunological responses104, inflammation, and non-specificity of cell targeting105. Further, AV-mediated gene transfer is relatively inefficient in the absence of epithelial damage. However, this is not a limitation in the case of ALI/ARDS which is characterized by epithelial barrier dysfunction104.\n\n### Adeno-associated virus (AAV)",

        "text": "AAV is a small single-stranded DNA nonpathogenic parvovirus that is replication-defective and needs a helper virus to complete its lytic life cycle106^{,}107. AVVs are safer and less immunogenic compared to AV104^{,}105, which makes them an attractive candidate for gene delivery. However, they have lower transfection efficiency101. The AAV serotypes have different tissue tropisms due to different capsid proteins. The serotype AAV6 has been reported to be the most effective vector in infecting pulmonary epithelium101^{,}104. Interestingly, AVV capsid has been modified to improve both the safety and efficacy of these vectors for their application in gene therapy of several human diseases especially lung diseases107. Recently, Duncan et al.108 highlighted the mucus-penetrating ability of AAV6 as a potential mechanism to achieve robust in vivo lung gene transfer and effective inhaled gene therapy. Successfully, AAV6 was used in a recent study to deliver miRNA-21-5p intending to inhibit apoptosis of ATII cells in hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI) rats' model108^{,}109. Encouragingly, two AAV-based therapies have been approved by the FDA, luxturna (AAV2-based drug) indicated for rare eye disease and zolgensma, (AAV9-based drug) for spinal muscular atrophy, in 2017 and 2019, respectively106^{,}110^{,}111.\n\n### Retroviruses\n\nRetroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses characterized by their ability to reverse transcribing single-stranded RNA into dsDNA, before its insertion into the genome21^{,}101^{,}112. The non-specificity, the insertional mutagenesis, and the risk of tumorigenesis are their major drawbacks101^{,}104. The most common type of retroviruses is lentivirus. Lentiviral vectors have been reported to have lower genotoxicity risk compared to other retroviral vectors112.\n\nGenerally, despite the high transduction efficiency of viral vectors, their clinical application is limited by cytotoxicity, high immunogenicity, high potential of harmful insertional mutagenesis in the host genome, and even carcinogenesis113. Besides, viral delivery systems are more suitable for RNAi therapeutics that require transport into the nucleus such as miRNA and shRNA but not for siRNA that acts in the cytoplasm.\n\n###\n\n### Non-viral vectors\n\nNon-viral carriers have been developed to avoid the immune system stimulation associated with viral vectors25. Despite their relative safety and low-cost production61, these vectors generally do not possess the high level of tissue tropism and transfection efficiency of viral vectors114. The non-viral vectors applied for the pulmonary delivery of siRNA include various delivery systems, such as lipid-based, polymer-based, peptide-based delivery systems, and hybrid nanoparticles, etc.\n\n### Lipid-based delivery vectors\n\nCommonly, lipid-based systems are the most investigated vectors for siRNA delivery. These include liposomes, stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), pH-responsive lipids, and exosomes (Table 3 and Fig. 6)115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125.\n\n#### Lipoplexes (cationic liposomes)\n\nSo far, liposomes are the only nanomedicine approved by the FDA for inhalation75. Two types of liposomes could deliver siRNA to the lung, cationic liposomes by complexation and neutral liposomes by encapsulation136. Cationic liposomes are considered the most attractive nanocarriers for siRNA delivery. Typically, the positively charged head of cationic lipids, such as DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane), DOTMA (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium), DOSPA (2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2-(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium), DDAB (dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide), DOGS (dioctadecyl amido glycin spermine), and DC-Chol (3β-(N-(N′,N′-dimethylethylenediamine)-carbamoyl) cholesterol), binds with the anionic phosphate groups of the nucleic acid to form lipoplexes of 50--200 nm in diameter through spontaneous electrostatic interaction115^{,}121^{,}122^{,}125. Lipoplexes are easy to prepare, protect siRNA from degradation, and have high transfection efficiency102^{,}115.\n\nThe cationic lipids can directly fuse with anionic membranes and release their payload into the cytosol. Besides this direct fusion, lipoplexes are most commonly internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, the positive charge of cationic lipids increases due to the low endosomal/lysosomal pH which in turn augments the affinity between the anionic endosomal/lysosomal membrane and the lipoplex. Finally, the exchange of lipids between lipoplexes and biological membranes, enhanced by the fusogenic character of liposomes, promotes the release of siRNA into the cytosol (Fig. 7)66^{,}88^{,}137^{,}138. The transfection efficiency can be further improved by optimizing the ratio of lipid:siRNA or N/P ratio (Nitrogen to phosphate ratio) to obtain a slightly positive charged lipoplex102.\n\nVarious modifications have been made to protect cationic liposomes from non-specific interactions, reduce their immunological responses and cellular toxicity, and promote endosomal escape. This was achieved by the addition of PEG on their surface to form “stealth liposomes”57^{,}136. However, PEGylation may be more advantageous in the systemic delivery challenged with the reticuloendothelial clearance system than the pulmonary administration since it can hinder their interaction with the cell membrane, and thereby reduce the transfection efficiency136. The inclusion of fusogenic lipids, such as DOPE in cationic liposomes is thought to increase the interactions between the liposomal and endosomal membranes facilitating the release of siRNA125^{,}136^{,}139. Many commercially available transfection agents such as Lipofectin (DOTMA/DOPE), or lipofectamine (DOSPA/DOPE) which are based on cationic liposomes, were implemented for siRNA transfection62^{,}122.",

        "text": "Despite the several advantages of cationic liposomes, including efficient in vitro transfection, high loading capacity, structural flexibility, excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of large-scale production, their advancement is still hindered by some drawbacks. These include safety concerns, nonspecific tissue uptake, and premature siRNA release due to their interaction with proteins, lipoproteins, and the extracellular matrix116, 117, 118, 119. Furthermore, cationic liposomes are highly toxic to immune cells and can induce their clearance by macrophages through activation of the complement cascade115^{,}118. Contrarily to their neutral and negatively charged counterparts, cationic liposomes can contribute to lung inflammation and toxicity by prompting the production of ROS117. Besides the size and surface charge, cationic liposome-induced toxicity is influenced by the nature and concentration of cationic lipid, as well as lipids:siRNA ratio. These characteristics should be thoroughly considered to develop safe and efficient lipoplexes122^{,}123^{,}140.

Interestingly, treatment with naked siRNA mainly affected EpiCs but did not target ECs. In contrast, PD-L1 siRNA delivery\n\nby liposome mostly targeted ECs, but not EpiCs. Consequently, i.v. administration of liposomes loading the same siRNA attenuated the development of Hem-CLP induced ALI. These results were not observed when naked siRNA was given intratracheally, due to the key role of pulmonary ECs in mediating the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway mainly targeted by i.v. delivery of the liposomal form[91]. In another study conducted by Dong et al.[92], Lipofectamine loaded with siRNA was administered intratracheally to suppress Receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) upregulated in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced ALI mouse model. Rip2 knockdown successfully ameliorated CS\n\nTable 3 Summary of the advantages and drawbacks of different lipid-based delivery carriers that can be used for siRNA pulmonary delivery against ALI/ARDS.",

The loss of net charge improves the safety profile of lipid vectors, but it hinders their interaction with siRNA resulting in a relatively low siRNA entrapment compared to their cationic counterparts (less than 10%). Hence, neutral lipids are often used as transfection enhancers with other vectors123^{,}136. Frequently, DOPE is used as a fusogenic lipid to mediate endosomal release due to its ability to shift to an inverted hexagonal phase at the acidic environment of endosomes supporting the fusion between the nanocarrier and the endosomal membrane120.\n\n#### Stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs)\n\nSNALPs were first developed in 2001 as a new generation of cationic liposomes. SNALPs are composed of a mixture of an ionizable positively charged phospholipid, such as 1,2-dioleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DODMA) or 1,2-dioleyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP), as well as a neutral helper lipid (including Chol and fusogenic lipids), to overcome the two siRNA intracellular barriers (cellular uptake and endosomal release), with a PEG-coating to prevent degradation and non-specific interactions122^{,}125.\n\n#### Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs)\n\nBesides the liposomal formulations, SLNs have been adapted for siRNA delivery to the lung to avoid stability issues associated with liposomes. SLNs are composed of a neutral hydrophobic core, where siRNA can be incorporated by the hydrophobic ion-pairing approach and coated with a lipid membrane116^{,}125. Usually, lipids such as fatty acids/esters/alcohols, triglycerides, waxes, and cholesterol, are used in formulating SLNs127. Most recently, aerosolizable TNF-α siRNA-encapsulated SLNs were successfully prepared for potential pulmonary delivery, suggesting the possibility to deliver the siRNA-SLNs dry powder into the lung to silence the gene expression of a gene of interest in cells, such as AMs or lung EpiCs126.\n\n#### Multifunctional envelope-type nano device (MEND)",

        "text": "MEND is a nanoparticle in which siRNA is entrapped in the inner phase of a lipid bilayer modified with functional molecules such as peptides. Also, pH-responsive lipids can be incorporated into the lipid membranes to control their intracellular traficking116. For example, a GALA-MEND has been recently designed and optimized by incorporating a pH-responsive lipid (YSK05) to deliver CD31 siRNA to the pulmonary endothelium based on GALA peptide targeting129. The incorporated YSK05 enhanced the endosomal release of the optimized MEND resulting in an improved knockdown in the lung endothelium by comparison with DOTMA or DOTAP-MENDs when intravenously injected into mice. Furthermore, the incorporated helper lipids such as DOPE synergistically enhanced both the selectivity and efficiency of the designed MEND129. Thus, GALA modified MEND may be a potential carrier of siRNA in curing various lung diseases including ALI/ARDS128.\n\n#### Exosomes (EXOs)\n\nEXOs are endogenous extracellular nanovesicles deriving from the endosomal system with a particle size ranging from 30 to 150 nm. EXOs are released by various types of cells into the extracellular environment as nature's nano delivery system of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, playing an important role in intercellular communication133, 134, 135^{,}143.\n\nInterestingly, Zhang et al.93 used serum-derived exosomes as vehicles to deliver siRNA against Myd88 (involved in innate immune signaling) to the lung. siRNAs were first loaded into serum EXOs via modified calcium-mediated transfection and then were intratracheally instilled in LPS-induced ALI mouse model. Efficiently, the siRNA-carriers were internalized by AMs, achieved specific gene silencing, and modulated LPS-induced inflammation. More interestingly, serum-derived EXOs themselves were neither inflammogenic nor immunogenic when delivered into the lung. Curiously, the intratracheally instilled EXOs were only taken up by AMs, but not by LPS-activated neutrophils. Accordingly, the delivery of EXO-based siRNA to other lung cells, such as EpiCs, requires the development of new methods to avoid their uptake by AMs93.Another study suggests that exosomes of human induced pluripotent stem cells with a size of 122 nm isolated by differential centrifugation, could be used as a natural delivery system of ICAM-1 siRNA to inhibit the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) protein expression in HMVECs (Human primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells). Exosomes were successfully internalized by LPS activated HMVECs, leading to selective suppression of ICAM-1 surface expression in vitro which may alleviate ALI in vivo144. Based on those findings, EXOs seem like an attractive candidate for siRNA delivery because of their natural potential to carry genetic material, their native biocompatibility with low inherent immunogenicity and toxicity in comparison with exogenous carriers130, 131, 132. Furthermore, they can potentially evade the endosomal pathway and lysosomal degradation134. However, their purification techniques are cumbersome and expensive for large-scale manufacturing131^{,}133.\n\n### Polymer-based delivery vectors\n\nPolymer-based vectors are attractive candidates for siRNA delivery systems because of their facile synthesis and lower immunogenicity compared to liposomes145. Generally, polymer-based carriers can be separated into two categories: polycations and polymeric nanoparticles.\n\n#### Polycations\n\nSimilar to lipoplexes, polyplexes or dendriplexes are formed by electrostatic interactions between their cationic amine (N) groups and the anionic phosphate (P) groups of nucleic acids. They include synthetic polycations such as polyethylenimine (PEI), polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers, and natural polycations such as chitosan146. The transfection efficiency of cationic polymers is influenced by their structure, size, and surface charge. Also, the degree of complexation quantified by the N/P ratio affects the net charge, size, and stability of the delivery system147. Typically, an excess of the polymer is needed to generate stable cationic vehicles and facilitate their internalization148. However, an excessively high positive charge may cause cytotoxicity149. Hence, an appropriate N/P ratio should be found for each system to assure the balance between transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity147. The polycations internalized by the clathrin-dependent pathway use the “proton sponge” effect to escape from endosomes150. The proton sponges cationic polymers, such as PEI and PAMAM, prevent acidification of endocytic vesicles owing to their high buffering capacity inciting the membranes H^{+}-ATPases to actively translocate H^{+} from the cytoplasm into the endosome to maintain the desired pH. The increased protonation causes an influx of chloride and water into the endosome leading to disruption of the endosomal membrane, and eventually endosomal escape of the endocytosed polyplexes into the cytosol150, 151, 152.\n\nAlthough PEI has an excellent gene condensation ability, high buffering capacity leading to great endosome escape activity, and\n\nhigh transfection efficiency153, it suffers from molecular weight-dependent cytotoxicity and nonbiodegradability hindering its application as an effective delivery system154. The positive charge of PEI has been incriminated in necrotic and apoptotic cell death both in vitro and in vivo152. Also, it has been demonstrated that linear PEIs are less toxic than their branched counterparts155.\n\n##### Polyplexes",

        "text": "In vivo-jetPEI™ is a linear PEI that has low toxicity and high efficiency for local gene and siRNA delivery compared to the other cationic lipids and polymers156. Fu et al.94 used JetPEI polyplex as a transfecting agent to deliver paxillin siRNA into the mouse lung by intratracheal instillation to suppress LPS-induced paxillin accumulation which is hypothesized to mediate the associated endothelial hyperpermeability. Resultantly, in vivo knockdown of paxillin attenuated LPS-induced pulmonary endothelial hyperpermeability and injury. Further, other pulmonary cells might be affected by this knockdown94.\n\nIn a previous study, dexamethasone-conjugated PEI (DEXA-PEI) was utilized as a siRNA vehicle into lung tissue for the knockdown of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) overexpressed in particulate matter (PM)-induced airway inflammation. The results showed that DEXA-PEI/MIF siRNA reduced the PM-induced MIF expression in PM-activated EpiCs compared to naked MIF siRNA after intratracheal application in mice. The maximized reduction of inflammation compared to dexamethasone (which itself, with or without scrambled siRNA, has an anti-inflammatory effect) suggested the synergistic effect between siRNA and the developed delivery system157.\n\nFluorination may increase the stability of polycations, lower their toxicity, and improve cellular siRNA delivery through enhancement of cellular uptake and endosomal escape158. Interestingly, perfluorocarbon (PFC), a biocompatible polymer widely used in pulmonary therapies due to its high oxygen dissolving capacity, has been demonstrated to attenuate ARDS in both humans and animals159. For example, it has been demonstrated that lung delivery of vaporized PFC improved the gas exchange in a detergent-induced lung injury160. Another study also stated that inhalation of PFC may protect from blast lung injury159. Similarly, it was reported that i.v. administration of PFC emulsion significantly improved LPS-induced ALI in rat's model161. Therefore, PFC may represent an excellent candidate for siRNA delivery of ALI/ARDS. To achieve combined inhibition of CXCR4 (C--X--C motif chemokine receptor type 4) and PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) which are overexpressed in ALI, Wang et al.95 prepared PFC emulsion polyplexes containing a fluorinated polymeric CXCR4 antagonist for the delivery of siRNA against PAI-1. The resultant polyplex emulsions protected siRNA from degradation and boosted siRNA uptake and endosomal escape with no significant cytotoxicity observed. After intratracheal instillation, PFC emulsion polyplexes showed strong lung retention and improved therapeutic outcomes in LPS-induced ALI model in mice95. However, some reports indicated that the presence of fluorine can negatively influence the pulmonary distribution of siRNA polyplexes. It was found that siRNA-nonfluorinated polyplexes were mainly accumulated in the lungs after i.v. delivery in contrast to their fluorinated counterparts that were majorly distributed to the liver. Beneficially, the fluorine modification did remarkably reduce PEI cytotoxicity without altering its binding affinity and improved the in vitro siRNA delivery potency162.\n\n##### Polymeric micelles (PMs)\n\nPMs are nanocarriers (usually <100 nm) formed of a hydrophilic polymeric shell, such as PEG, and a hydrophobic core, such as PEI163^{,}164. Their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and relatively high stability make them attractive delivery systems165. Cationic micelle-forming block polymers can be used to trap negatively charged siRNAs in their core via electrostatic interaction166. Interestingly, PMs can be engineered to achieve active targeting and improved cellular uptake by their conjugation with specific targeting ligands or stimuli-responsive components167. However, they are limited by low loading efficiency and complexity in transport through the cell membrane166.\n\nMost recently, Hou J et al.168 developed PMs composed of branched PEI modified with PEGs and loaded with siRNAs against PTPN13 (protein tyrosine phosphatase-N13) and NADPH oxidase-4, which are promoters of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) that constitutes a severe complication in ALI/ARDS. The fibroblast-targeting was achieved by the anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) antibody onto the carrier. The developed carrier achieved remarkable antifibrotic effects and successfully suppressed the development of bleomycin-induced PF in murine model168. The same PMs loaded with siRNA against runt-related transcription factor-1 and decorated with an anti-stem-cell antigen-1 antibody could successfully inhibit PF in mice by preventing the differentiation of lung resident mesenchymal stem cells into myofibroblast169.\n\n##### Dendriplexes\n\nPolycationic dendrimers, characterized by their unique three-dimensional structure, can also be used to condense siRNA into dendriplexes170. Cationic PAMAM and phosphorus dendrimers were widely tested for siRNA delivery owing to their positive charge, their high degree of surface functionality, their excellent buffering capacity, and high transfection efficiency149.",

        "text": "PAMAM dendrimers were applied to locally deliver TNF-α siRNA to the lung. Compared with non-complexed siRNAs, the cationic dendriplexes with a size between 127 and 153 nm displayed a high siRNA condensation, low cytotoxicity, increased cellular uptake, and transfection performance, and efficiently silence TNF-α in vitro in LPS-activated macrophages. The intranasal pre-administration of PAMAM dendriplexes in a murine LPS-induced lung inflammation model resulted in improved performance 4 h after the LPS challenge. However, PAMAM dendriplexes showed lower efficacy than non-complexed TNF-α siRNA on the 3rd day, requiring more frequent administrations. This could be explained by the higher stability of the non-complexed siRNA and their deep penetration into the lung retarding their removal compared to dendriplexes that undergo fast mucociliary clearance96. Interestingly, Agnoletti et al.171 engineered inhalable dry powders of TNF-α siRNA-loaded G4 PAMAM dendriplexes embedded in microparticles formed of a saccharide matrix, aiming to avoid the unfavorable exhalation of nanoparticles and facilitate their transport. The designed system was well-tolerated and showed an enhanced cellular uptake of siRNA leading to efficient silencing of TNF-α in LPS-activated macrophages. Favorably, the suitability of this system for inhalation therapy was confirmed by the efficient knockdown and the preserved siRNA integrity upon spray drying in the reconstituted NPs171.\n\nComparatively, it has been reported that cationic phosphorus dendrimers have better delivery efficiency of siRNA than PAMAM dendrimers172. Further, these dendrimers themselves could possess a potent anti-inflammatory action173. A previous study conducted by Bohr et al.97 inspected the potential of TNF-α siRNA cationic phosphorus dendrimers to modulate LPS-induced ALI both in vitro and in vivo. In their research, phosphorus third-generation (G3) dendrimers were functionalized with either cationic pyrrolidinium (DP) or morpholinium (DM) terminal groups. Results showed a strong binding between siRNA and both DP and DM dendrimers, with stronger binding for DP. This was attributed to the different pKa values between DP (8.1) and DM (7.1) resulting in higher ionization of DP in the pH of complexation. However, DP dendriplexes exhibited higher cytotoxicity against macrophages. This could be partly related to their higher surface charge. Similarly, DP dendriplexes showed better cellular uptake and improved in vitro silencing efficiency of TNF-α in LPS-activated macrophages than DM dendriplexes and/or non-complexed siRNA. In correlation with in vitro results, the nasal administration of DP dendriplexes in LPS-induced ALI murine model strongly inhibited TNF-α expression, much higher than DM dendriplexes and free siRNA97. Accordingly, in implementing dendriplexes for siRNA delivery, the dose should be carefully adjusted to compromise between achieving the highest efficacy and at the same time avoiding carrier-associated toxicity.\n\nPoly-l-lysine (PLL) is a well-known cationic polymer that has been widely studied as a non-viral gene delivery vector owing to its strong positive charge74. Recently, Yang J et al.80 used dendritic PLL to deliver TNF-α siRNA to the lung. Interestingly, they have used charge-reversible pro-peptide of RAGE-binding peptide modified with cis-aconitic anhydride for the surface-coating of the delivery nanocomplex and giving it a negative surface charge. This allowed an efficient mucosal penetration of the developed nanosystem after intratracheal delivery. Then, the positive charge was recovered in the mild acidity of the inflamed alveolar space (pH ≈ 6.8), allowing efficient transfection of AMs and TNF-α silencing80.\n\n#### Polymeric nanoparticles\n\nThe polyplex formation depends on electrostatic interactions and the anionic nature of the RNA payload. However, their superstructure may be compromised by the competitive interactions with other physiological polyanions147. For this reason, polymers capable of forming neutral or anionic NPs have been suggested. Unlike polycations, siRNA is either dispersed throughout the polymeric matrix or adsorbed on the NPs surface. Appropriate surfactants or cationic polymers such as PEI or chitosan can be added to the matrix174. Practically, the delivery of siRNA by these materials is challenged by their relatively low nucleic acid loading and transfection efficiency147^{,}148.",

        "text": "NPs based on hydrophobic polymers such as PLGA [poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid)] have attracted more attention to deliver siRNA57^{,}174^{,}175. The endosomal escape of PLGA NPs is due to the surface charge reversal caused by the pH change from anionic (in the physiological and alkaline pH) to cationic (in the endosome/lysosome acidic pH)147^{,}174. After the endosomal escape, PLGA nanoparticles may remain in the cytosol for more than 14 days, allowing a slow release of the payload174. Further, combination with cationic polymers or cationic lipids can improve its transfection efficiency and intracellular trafficking176. Frede et al.177 designed a multi-shell nanoparticle (size of 145 nm and zeta potential of + 23 mV), consisting of a calcium phosphate core, coated with siRNAs, encapsulated within PLGA, and finally coated with a final outer layer of PEI, as a vehicle for local treatment of pulmonary inflammatory disorders. Successfully, multiple nasal instillations of the calcium phosphate PLGA NPs loaded with siRNAs against different pro-inflammatory mediators (CCL-2, IP-10, and IFN-γ) to mice suffering from TH1 cell-mediated lung inflammation showed fruitful internalization (mainly endocytosed by macrophages and dendritic cells and less by EpiCs and lymphocytes), protected siRNA molecules, and decreased gene expression, thereby mitigated the inflammatory responses in the lung177.\n\n### Peptide-based delivery vectors\n\nPeptides are other possible carriers that can be applied for siRNA delivery because of their stability, low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability179. Peptides can be used alone or as an assistant component to other systems, such as fusogenic peptides used to bypass the endosomal entrapment barrier and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) used to facilitate the cellular entry180.\n\n#### Fusogenic peptides\n\nFusogenic peptides are short peptides that can promote endosomal release by increasing interactions with endosomal membrane178. GALA is a synthetic pH-sensitive fusogenic peptide able to convert from a random coil structure at pH^{∗}6 to an amphipathic a-helical structure able to insert into membranes and cause membrane leakage at pH^{∗}6, promoting the endosomal escape181^{,}182. As abovementioned, GALA-modified MEND has been proposed as a siRNA carrier to take advantage of the dual role of GALA, enhancing the endosomal release, and targeting the lung endothelium129.\n\n#### Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs)\n\nCPPs are short chains of about 30 or fewer amino acids. Based on differences in physicochemical characters, CPPs can be classified into three classes: cationic, hydrophobic, and amphipathic183, 184, 185. Internalization of siRNA conjugated with CPPs can be mediated via endocytic or nonendocytic pathways depending on the particle size, peptide type, and siRNA loading method186. However, some CPPs have limitations due to non-specificity and easy proteolysis182. Moreover, CPP-mediated delivery of siRNAs is majorly challenged by endosomal entrapment187. It has been reported that CPPs remain localized in the endosome and are further captured by lysosomes rather than undergoing endosomal escape188. Therefore, various modifications have been used with CPPs to promote endosomal escape and improve RNAi efficiency. This includes the attachment of fusogenic peptides such as HA2 peptide derived from influenza virus hemagglutinin, fusogenic lipids such as DOPE, or the use of buffering agents such as chloroquine178. Generally, CPPs can either vectorize siRNA by direct covalent conjugation through a linker or by non-covalent conjugation through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between CPPs and siRNA, typically forming nanoparticle structures184^{,}189. So far, no CPPs or CPPs/cargo complexes have been approved by the FDA185.\n\n##### Covalent CPPs delivery of siRNA\n\nBesides the activation of innate immunity, the covalent conjugation of siRNA to CPPs can sterically hinder the interaction between siRNA and RISC reducing its efficiency. Additionally, conjugates with charged nucleic acids are unstable and difficult to purify187^{,}190^{,}191. Hence, covalent modification is most suitable for charge-neutral oligonucleotides than charged molecules such as siRNA120.\n\n##### Non-covalent CPP delivery of siRNA\n\nThe formation of nanoparticle complexes between anionic nucleic acids\n\nand CPPs is mainly driven by electrostatic and/or hydrophobic interactions120^{,}189^{,}190. Nevertheless, CPPs have poor encapsulating efficiency, and the nanoparticles formed are more heterogeneous and less defined than their CPP/siRNA conjugate counterparts186^{,}187. Further, CPPs have relatively low transfection efficiency requiring additional modifications to form efficient and stable CPP polyplexes because of their low molecular weight, weak electron charge density, inefficient gene complexation capability, limited capacity for endosomal escape, and rapid degradation under physiological conditions. Generally, CPPs are not used alone but as assistant components in lipoplexes and polymeric polyplexes178.",

For example, R3V6, a cationic amphiphilic peptide was used as a carrier for the delivery of the combinational therapy of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase siRNA (siS1PLyase), reported to be involved in acute pulmonary inflammation, and recombinant HMGB1A, an antagonist of the pro-inflammatory cytokine HMGB1. The ternary NPs of siS1PLyase-HMGB1A-R3V6 has been designed to test the synergistic effect of siS1PLyase-HMGB1A against LPS-induced ALI model98^{,}192. Remarkably, the ternary NPs and siRNA/R3V6 nanocomplexes displayed higher stability compared with naked siRNA or siRNA/PEI, confirming that R3V6 could protect siRNA from nucleases and proteases. The designed nanocomplex exhibited similar delivery efficiency into the lung EpiCs compared to siRNA-HMGB1A-PEI and siRNA-HMGB1A-Lipofectamine. Moreover, it was shown to be less toxic than both of them with higher anti-inflammatory potency against LPS-activated macrophages. Consistently, the intratracheal administration of siS1PLyase-HMGB1A-R3V6 NPs efficiently reduced the S1PLyase level, the inflammatory response, and apoptosis in lung tissue. These findings confirmed the advantages of the peptide R3V6 over other types of carriers in terms of toxicity and combined delivery of siS1PLyase and HMGB1A98.\n\nLater, Ge et al.99 developed guanidinated and fluorinated bifunctional polypeptides for the lung delivery of TNF-α siRNA into AMs aiming to simultaneously enhance siTNF-α polyplexes cell membrane penetration by the guanidine groups, and enable their transmucus penetration by fluorocarbon modification. Resultantly, the cellular uptake of fluorinated siTNF-α-loaded cationic polypeptides by macrophages was more effective than free siRNA, nonfluorinated, and PEI-siRNA polyplexes. Remarkably, the fluorine modification of the cationic polypeptides potentiated the mucus permeation by 240 folds. Compatibly, the TNF-α knockdown of all the fluorinated polypeptides in LPS-activated macrophages was more effective than the nonfluorinated and PEI-siRNA polyplexes. This was confirmed in vivo by a potent TNF-α silencing, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, recovered pulmonary ventilation function, and alleviated tissue damage in the LPS-ALI mice model after intratracheal administration99.\n\n### Hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs)\n\nHybrid lipid-polymer NPs combine both the natural biocompatibility and low immunogenicity of lipids, and the high binding affinity for RNA of polymeric nanocarriers90^{,}193. In this respect, Angelo et al.194 designed hybrid lipid-polymer nanoparticles (size of 150 nm, and zeta potential close to -25mV) as a pulmonary delivery carrier of siRNA to the human airway EpiCs. They used PLGA and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), with or without PEI as the third component in their formulations194. DPPC, the principal lipid constituent of pulmonary surfactant, was expected to moderate HNPs interactions in the airways195, while the inclusion of PEI would likely enhance siRNA entrapment inside the HNPs. Resultantly, the optimized siRNA-loaded HNPs displayed an optimal in vitro aerodynamic behavior after administration with a vibrating mesh nebulizer. They exhibited good stability in artificial mucus, excellent penetration inside extracellular lung barriers, and efficient internalization inside the airway EpiCs without inducing any proinflammatory or cytotoxic effects194.\n\nRecently, Dormenval et al.196 aimed to design physiochemically stable inhalable solid dosage forms for siRNA delivery suitable for large-scale production. Therefore, they prepared spray-dried TNF-α siRNA-loaded lipidoid-PLGA hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) supposed to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-associated inflammation. The prepared TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs (size of 197.1 nm, PDI of 0.098, and zeta potential of 18.1 mV) were maintained in the same range till 10-fold scaled up formulations. Favorably, the spray drying neither affected the siRNA integrity, nor the in vitro release and thereby efficient gene silencing was maintained196.\n\nKusumoto et al.197 designed a GALA-modified MEND constituted of an anionic core of siRNA-PEI coated with a cationic liposomal envelope of DOTMA, EPC (egg phosphatidylcholine), and cholesterol. They aimed to study the impact of GALA surface modification which was supposed to enhance the endosomal release and target the pulmonary ECs. GALA/MEND loaded with siRNA against CD31 could efficiently silence the endothelial marker gene CD31 compared to the unmodified MEND indicating the high potency of this system to deliver siRNA to the lung endothelium, one of the promising targets to treat ALI/ARDS197.\n\nInterestingly, Merckx et al.100 designed a hybrid nanoparticle composed of siRNA-loaded cationic dextran nanogel core coated with a shell of the hydrophobic surfactant protein B (SP-B) and incorporated in a phospholipid mixture of DOPC and eggPG (LL-α-phosphatidylglycerol), or DPPC and eggPG. The proteolipid coated siRNA-loaded nanogels were then administered by tracheal aspiration to silence TNF-α in LPS-induced ALI murine model. Remarkably, the incorporation of SP-B model in the DPPC:eggPG coated formulation improved cytosolic siRNA delivery to the respiratory immune cells leading to a significant gene silencing compared to other nanocomposites. However, the administration of these nanocomposites to the naïve mice increased the inflammatory markers100. Most recently, the same group has demonstrated that the proteolipid coated siRNA-loaded nanogels can be freeze-dried and then reconstituted before nebulization for inhalation therapy without influencing their integrity or efficiency198.\n\n## Conclusions and outlook",

        "text": "The field of siRNA therapy is attracting great interest due to its potential therapeutic to silence any gene of interest including the deadliest diseases, such as ALI/ARDS. Despite the extensive studies and the multiple possible targets of ALI/ARDS, there are still no specific pharmacological treatments. To date, the best practice against ALI/ARDS remains protective ventilation that can aggravate lung damage or even cause lung injury. Therefore, gene silencing via siRNA can be implemented to open up new treatment opportunities for ALI/ARDS. Many preclinical reports are supporting the suitability of siRNA-based therapies for ALI/ARDS by recovering the integrity of lung epithelial and/or\n\nPulmonary delivery of siRNA for treatment of ALI/ARDS\n\nendothelial barriers or reinforcing the pulmonary defense mechanisms. However, the majority of these studies focus only on the target of siRNA instead of looking into the delivery perspective. The pulmonary route seems to be the best choice to deliver siRNA into the lung effectively and safely. Despite the advantages of naked siRNA delivery, namely its simplicity and reduced toxicity, the results obtained from the local administration of free siRNA were controversial between different studies. Multiple designed vectors for gene delivery are used in several diseases. However, only some of them have been tested for siRNA delivery against ALI/ARDS. Most of the relevant studies used the available commercial transfection agents such as Lipofectamine, known for their inherent toxicity and instability. Hence, to be feasible and viable in the clinic, the development of an efficient and safe delivery system suitable for the pulmonary delivery of siRNA against ALI/ARS seems promising. This has been proved by a lot of recent studies that demonstrated the possibility to maintain the integrity of siRNA while formulating inhalable forms.\n\nBoth viral and non-viral vector systems have been designed or adapted to protect siRNA and deliver it to its cytosolic target after bypassing the different extracellular and intracellular barriers. Given the inherent immunogenicity of viral vectors, non-viral vectors are increasingly used to deliver nucleic acids. Although non-viral delivery systems are less efficient than viral vectors, they are less immunogenic, less expensive, and easier to produce in large amounts. Exosomes have also been proposed to deliver siRNA into the lung as nature's nano delivery system. However, exosome-mediated delivery is mainly hindered by purification techniques. Comparatively, liposomal delivery systems showed good transfection efficiency, polymer-based nanocarriers displayed sustained release profiles and higher cellular internalization potential, and peptide vectors exhibited enhanced endosomal escape. Interestingly, hybrid nanocarriers seem to be the best delivery system since it allows to combine the advantages of these different carriers into one single vector. Nevertheless, sophisticated approaches usually have characterization and manufacturing scale-up difficulties that may hinder their clinical translation.\n\nStrategies such as the use of a cocktail of siRNAs silencing different mRNAs might be used in combination for targeting different pathways to provide a synergistic silencing effect given the complex pathological mechanisms and pathways involved in ALI/ARDS. Also, the use of targeting peptides to maximize uptake of vectors into alveolar cells or the codelivery of siRNA with other therapeutic agents may further improve the therapeutic outcomes. Innovative nebulization technologies are also needed to improve the delivery of siRNA/carrier to the distal lung while maintaining its integrity.\n\nBesides the delivery issues, there still exist many limitations to overcome. These include safety issues, manufacturing scale-up, the development of inhalation devices that can both maintain siRNA integrity and be suitable for patients under mechanical ventilation. Further, the extrapolation of results from animal studies to human applications is another bottleneck regarding the big differences in the airways between rodents and humans. Various injury models should be combined to create a similar human ALI/ARDS model such as cecal ligation and puncture followed by hemorrhage rather than LPS injury alone. Moreover, in some studies, siRNA treatment was given preventively or in the early phase of the disease which is not practical in the clinical application where the diagnosis and treatment of ARDS are delayed. Frequently, the studies assessed only the inflammatory mediators' levels without histopathological investigations which is",

Additionally, the fibroproliferation process may present another promising target for siRNA therapy besides the inflammatory process. Remarkably, most of the studies that investigated the efficiency of delivery vectors in ALI/ARDS used limited targets such as anti-TNF- $\\alpha$  siRNA. Similarly, studies that investigated the potential therapeutic targets for siRNA in ALI/ARDS did not focus on the delivery strategies. However, for successful outcomes, both the targets and the delivery strategies should be considered while developing a siRNA therapy for ALI/ARDS. Despite the encouraging preclinical results, the authorities do not list any clinical trial on siRNA delivery against ALI/ARDS. Therefore, more work is needed to develop the appropriate carrier delivering siRNA to the right target in the suitable device to see the first inhalable siRNA-based therapy against ALI/ARDS in the near future.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81872823, and 82073782), the Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (No. 19430741500), the Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine Preparation of Ministry of Education of Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM-201905, China).\n\n## Author contributions\n\nWei He conceived and designed the work.

Recent studies indicate that tissue cells and macrophages interact via the release of small extracellular vesicles (EVs) in processes where EVs released by stressed tissue cells can promote the activation and polarization of adjacent macrophages which can in turn release EVs and factors that can promote cell stress and tissue inflammation and injury, and vice versa. This review discusses the roles of such EVs in regulating such interactions to influence tissue inflammation and injury in a number of acute and chronic inflammatory disease conditions, and the potential applications, advantage and concerns for using EV-based therapeutic approaches to treat such conditions, including their potential role of drug carriers for the treatment of infectious diseases.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nADSCs, adipose-derived stem cells; AKI, acute kidney injury; ALI, acute lung injury; AMs, alveolar macrophages; BMSCs, bone marrow stromal cells; CLP, cecal ligation and puncture; DSS, dextran sodium sulphate; EVs, extracellular vesicles; HSPA12B, heat shock protein A12B; HUCMSCs, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; iNOS, inducible nitrogen oxide synthase; KCs, Kupffer cells; KLF4, kruppel-like factor 4; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MSCs, mesenchymal stromal cells; MVs, microvesicles; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PMFA, 5,7,30,40,50-pentamethoxyflavanone; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; SIRPα, signal regulatory protein α; TECs, tubular epithelial cells; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.\n\n*Corresponding authors.\n\nE-mail addresses: wanmh@scu.edu.cn (Meihua Wan), tonyhu@tulane.edu (Tony Y.

Introduction\n\nMacrophages are myeloid linage cells involved in innate immune responses that have historically been viewed as terminally-differentiated phagocytic cells that primarily exhibit pro-inflammatory phenotypes¹. Fate-mapping studies now indicate that macrophages involved in the regulation of tissue homeostasis have distinct origins, which we will herein refer to as tissue-resident and recruited macrophages²⁻⁴. Most tissue-resident macrophages derive from the yolk sac or fetal liver during embryonic development and migrate to their final site prior to the end of gestation, whereas recruited macrophages derive from circulating monocytes that continue to differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells during the organism's lifetime³⁻⁵. Monocytes that highly express Ly6c have pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity and accumulate at sites of inflammation, while monocytes with low levels of Ly6c expression are considered to be patrolling monocytes that crawl along and survey the vasculature and participate in early inflammatory and tissue repair responses⁶. Tissue-resident macrophages are generally considered to be responsible for maintaining homeostasis, but during tissue injury or infection they can initiate pro-inflammatory responses by secreting chemokines to drive the rapid influx of neutrophils and inflammatory leukocytes⁷. Alveolar macrophages are self-renewing, but decrease in other tissue-resident macrophage populations during infection or tissue injury are replaced by patrolling monocytes that enter the affected tissue and differentiate into macrophages⁸. The primary function of these recruited macrophages is to attenuate inflammation and promoted tissue repair by stimulating angiogenesis, inhibiting neutrophil recruitment, and clearing cell debris. Tissue-resident and recruited macrophages tend to exhibit functionally distinct phenotypes, but can sometimes be functionally interchangeable during certain inflammatory responses⁷,⁹⁻¹¹. Both tissue-resident and recruited macrophages play important roles in\n\nregulating the development and resolution of pro-inflammatory tissue microenvironments, as described later in this review.",

        "text": "Macrophages, including both tissue-resident and recruited macrophages, are classified as belonging to two distinct functional subsets: classically activated (M1) macrophages, which are primarily associated with pro-inflammatory immune responses; and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which are primarily involved in tissue repair (Fig. 1)¹². Nitric oxide (NO) released by M1 macrophages tends to inhibit cell proliferation and induce tissue damage, while ornithine secreted by M2 macrophages tends to promote cell proliferation and tissue repair responses¹². M2 polarization appears to be the default option for tissue-resident macrophages, but M2 and M1 macrophages can interconvert in response to specific environmental stimuli¹². M1 macrophages undergo polarization in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Toll-like receptor signaling to secrete an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-23, IL-12, IL-6, TNF-α] and chemokines (e.g., CXCL2, CCL8, CXCL4 and CCL5). M1 macrophages exhibit increased antigen presenting activity and pro-inflammatory phenotypes, and function to eliminate infections caused by bacterial, viral and fungal factors¹³,¹⁴. M2 macrophages are classified into three subpopulations (M2a, M2b and M2c) that arise in response to different stimuli. M2a macrophages are induced by exposure to IL-4 and IL-13, M2b macrophages by immune complex signalizing in conjunction with LPS or IL-1β, and M2c macrophage by anti-inflammatory stimuli, including glucocorticoids, IL-10 or TGF-β. All M2 macrophages express CD14 and secrete high levels of anti-inflammatory factors, including IL-10, arginase-1, CCL24, CCL22, and CCL17¹⁴,¹⁵. These cells play important roles in resolving inflammation at infection and tissue injury sites by suppressing pro-inflammatory immune responses and regulating tissue repair and angiogenesis.\n\nDetecting differences in gene and protein expression is the simplest and most useful method to determine macrophage polarization states. For example, M1 macrophages are characterized by the abundant expression of the class II major histocompatibility\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1 Macrophage polarization and phenotypes. Stimulation by TLR receptor signaling or by exposure to IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and TGF-β induces macrophages to adopt M1 or M2 phenotypes, respectively, which causes these macrophage subtypes to secrete distinct sets of cytokines and chemokines that exert pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects.\n\ncomplex (MHCII), MHCII-associated co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86, and CD11c and CCR2 after stimulation with IFN-γ or LPS. Similarly, macrophage expression of CD163, CD200R, and CD206 after treatment with IL-10 or IL-4 is considered a hallmark of M2 polarization14^{,}16. Macrophage activation and polarization is mediated by different signaling pathways, and the presence of distinct regulatory molecules involved in the polarization to specific macrophage subtypes can be employed as macrophage phenotype markers. Mediators of TLR-dependent M1 macrophage polarization include the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), NF-κB, PU.1, STAT1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBP-α) and IRF5. Transcription factors promoting M2 activation include C/EBP-β, IRF4, STAT6, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)14^{,}17. As discussed in the following sections, important interactions between M1 and M2 macrophages and the respective cell types they regulate rely on the activity of EVs as molecular information carriers.\n\nEVs are lipid bilayer-enclosed structures, formed either by outward budding of the plasma membrane or through an intracellular endocytic trafficking pathway18. EVs are typically classified into multiple sub-categories, with the most common classification scheme relying on differences of their diameters to segregate them three overlapping groups: exosomes (40--100 nm), microvesicles (MV; 100--1000 nm) and apoptotic bodies (50--5000 nm)19. Exosomes derive from the endosomal compartment, while MVs and apoptotic bodies bud from the plasma membrane, and each of these biogenesis processes is subject to different regulatory mechanisms. Given the potential for overlapping these groups during their characterization in the absence of additional information, this review will use “small EV” to refer to EVs populations that could contain exosomes and/or MVs to avoid classification errors in the absence of sufficient detail regarding EV isolation or characterization methods or data. Some small EVs, particularly exosomes, carry miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins that can influence the inflammatory response20. Exosomes are produced by the endosomal compartments of most cells, including multiple cell types that play important roles in immune and pro-inflammatory responses, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B lymphocytes21. Such exosomes can travel throughout the body via the circulatory system and traverse the blood--brain barrier and other tissue to boundaries to be taken up by target cells to participate in numerous biological and pathological processes, including tissue damage and repair responses22. Small EVs, including exosomes, are also frequently produced in greater abundance stressed versus unstressed cells, including cells in tissues experiencing autoimmune responses21. Small EVs produced by malignant, infected or otherwise stressed cells and tissues may contain regulatory molecules that are critical for both local and systemic inflammatory responses by promoting the activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines23. Increasing effort is devoted to determining pro-inflammatory factors carried by EVs can regulate inflammatory reactions and could be altered for therapeutic purposes.",

        "text": "Small EVs released by immune cells can stimulate the adaptive immune response by carrying MHCII-antigen peptide complexes24, but the protective effects of these small EVs can be altered when their source cells are exposed to inflammatory stimuli25. For example, under hypertensive conditions exosomes secreted by macrophages stimulate the release inflammatory factors upon their uptake by endothelial cells26, while endothelial cell EVs can also modulate macrophage phenotypes24 in one example of an EV-based interaction loops between macrophages and host cells under pro-inflammatory conditions. EVs secreted by macrophages are also able to influence the phenotypes of adjacent macrophages to induce inflammatory tissue responses. For instance, native M1-derived exosomes can effectively shift recipient macrophages from a tumor permissive M2 to a tumor restrictive M1 phenotype27. Substantial literature has described interactions between exosomes and macrophages in autoimmune or metabolic diseases21^{,}24. Small EVs secreted by macrophages and other cell types can act on their recipient cells to transmit regulation signals and effects through receptor-mediated endocytosis, receptor-mediated membrane fusion, and phagocytosis and by paracrine signaling upon the release of their cargoes to directly interact with specific receptors on the target cells22. Less is known about the specific EVs populations that are involved in some of these interactions given that EVs generated from the plasma membrane and endosome compartment may be difficult to distinguish since they are similar in size and may exhibit some degree of compositional overlap28.\n\nHere, we discuss the roles macrophages play in some inflammation-related diseases, and how EVs secreted by pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages can induce tissue damage, while EVs released by stem cells can alter macrophage phenotypes to regulate anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage responses. Finally, we discuss the potential advantages of employing native or modified EVs as novel therapeutics for the treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases, as well as additional questions and technical challenges that need to be addressed to allow the clinical translation of such applications.\n\n## EV-mediated interaction loops between macrophages and tissues in tissue damage\n\nMacrophages can exhibit substantial heterogeneity and plasticity, displaying a continuum of phenotypes, with the extremes represented by the M1 and M2 states29. M1 macrophage subtypes predominate at the onset of tissue injury, and can secrete reactive oxygen species and other pro-inflammatory factors that can disrupt normal cell metabolism, induce apoptosis, and exacerbate tissue ischemia to ultimately worsen tissue damage. In the injury-resolution phase, however, M2 macrophages become predominant and produce a variety of effector molecules and growth factors that can regulate myofibroblast activation, stem and tissue progenitor cell differentiation, and angiogenesis30^{,}31. Increasing evidence shows that macrophages take part in the regulation of tissue damage by releasing EVs with pro- or anti-inflammatory information to affect inflammation in their microenvironment, and that damaged tissue cells can release EVs to activate local macrophages to initiate these responses (Fig. 2), resulting in an EV interaction loop between macrophages and tissue cells during tissue injury.\n\n### Cardiac injury\n\nDuring the cardiac inflammation, circulating blood mononuclear cells are recruited into cardiac tissue and differentiate into macrophages that secrete exosomes that contribute to cardiac injury by attenuating the induction of angiogenesis and aggravating myocardial damage32^{,}33. The contribution of macrophage-derived EVs to this process was identified by findings revealing that while pro-inflammatory miR-155 levels were elevated in macrophages\n\nQian Hu et al.\n1496\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2 EV-mediated interactions between tissue macrophages and adjacent cells can induce tissue inflammation and injury. (A) Cardiac injury. M1 macrophages secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing miR-155 that induce cardiomyocyte dysfunction, while EVs secreted by injured cardiomyocytes can activate macrophages. Conversely, exosomes secreted by M2 macrophages carry miRNA-148a, which can target cardiomyocytes and reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. (B) Liver injury. EVs secreted by M1 macrophages can activate the hepatocyte NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and promote hepatocyte proliferation, liver fibrosis, and the secretion of inflammatory factors, including iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α, to cause liver injury. Stressed hepatocytes can secrete EV containing miR-192-5p, TRAIL and CD40L to promote M1 macrophage polarization. (C) Kidney injury. Tubular epithelial cells (TECs) secrete EVs enriched with miR-19b-3p, CCL2 and miR-23a that promote M1 macrophage polarization to induce tubulointerstitial inflammation. Conversely, M1 macrophages stimulated by high glucose secrete EVs that can activate NF-κB P65 signaling and promote proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells to cause kidney injury. (D) Lung injury. EVs secreted by lung epithelial cells carry miR-221, miR320a and caspase-3 to promote alveolar macrophages to adopt an M1 phenotype, while M1 macrophage EVs containing miR-155, miR-146a, miR-233 and miR-142 induce lung epithelial cell injury.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)",

        "text": "and cardiac fibroblasts in injured cardiac tissue, only the cardiac macrophages expressed the miR-155 precursor required to generate miR-155 and that macrophage-derived exosomes contained miR-155 that could be transferred to cardiac fibroblasts³⁴. Further, following myocardial infarction cardiac macrophages are reported to express the M1 macrophage markers CD86, CD11c and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and release pro-inflammatory exosomes containing miR-155, and can transfer miR-155 to endothelial cells, leading to cardiac dysfunction and the inhibition of angiogenesis²⁶. Conversely, exosomes derived from IL-4-induced M2 macrophages expressing the M2 macrophage markers CD163 and CD206 carry miRNA-148a, which can alleviate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting TXNIP and the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway³⁵. Finally, EVs secreted by neonatal cardiomyocytes are reported to polarize pro-inflammatory macrophages and exacerbate myocardial ischemia and its associated inflammatory responses³⁶, suggesting that EV-regulated crosstalk between macrophages and cardiomyocytes may also contribute to cardiac injury. Further studies are required to determine the initiator and relative\n\ncontribution of EVs from these cells during cardiac ischemia, although EVs derived from neonatal cardiomyocytes under normal and ischemic conditions appear to have similar polarizing affects, whether macrophages stimulate cardiomyocytes or whether cardiomyocytes activate macrophages first in this interaction loop. Additional studies are also necessary to evaluate whether adjusting the ratio of M1 and M2 macrophages in cardiac tissues using small EVs could serve as a therapeutic intervention during myocardial infarction.\n\n## 2.2. Liver injury\n\nTissue-resident liver macrophages are referred to as Kupffer cells (KC)³⁷, and several lines of evidence indicate that M1 KCs secrete pro-inflammatory factors that may induce liver damage, including reactive oxygen species, TNF-α, iNOS and IL-6. M2 KCs, conversely, release anti-inflammatory cytokines, which play important roles in liver repair³⁸. In addition to KCs, circulating monocytes also have a profound impact on liver injury as they are recruited both during homeostasis and injury-associated\n\ninflammation37. Emerging evidence suggests that small EVs, especially exosomes, derived from the recruited macrophages that differentiate from these invasive monocytes, have an important role in mediating liver injury39. For example, hepatocytes are reported to take up LPS-induced macrophage-derived exosomes and subsequently activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in liver injury39. Exosomes from LPS-treated THP-1 macrophages likewise promote hepatic stellate cell proliferation and induce hepatic fibrosis, a common pathological consequence of repeated liver injury40. These results indicate that exosomes secreted by pro-inflammatory KCs and by recruited macrophages alter the phenotypes of hepatic cells to promote hepatic tissue injury.\n\nThese interactions appear likely to be bidirectional, since hepatic cells can release small EVs that can activate or polarize macrophages in the hepatic microenvironment. For instance, after lipotoxic injury hepatocytes secrete exosomes that contain miR-192-5p, which can promote macrophages to undergo M1 polarization, while also releasing iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α into the liver environment to aggravate hepatocyte cellular dysfunction41. Small EVs secreted by such hepatocytes contain tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which was found to promote an inflammatory phenotype in recipient macrophages42. Hepatocyte dysfunction and pro-inflammatory macrophages induced by EVs-based interactions between hepatocytes and macrophages thus appear to be an important pathological basis for nonalcoholic hepatitis. Other hepatocyte--macrophage interactions have also been demonstrated by exposing hepatocytes to alcohol, which release small EVs carrying CD40 ligand to promote macrophage activation, including the activation of primary murine KC and human monocyte-derived macrophages43. Thus, hepatocytes and macrophages can each secrete small EVs that can promote pro-inflammatory activity in the other cell type, with the potential for form a feedback loop to enhance and maintain hepatic inflammation leading to liver injury.\n\n### Kidney injury",

        "text": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a growing global health concern, and animal models demonstrate that macrophages are major contributors to the inflammatory response associated with AKI44. Macrophages from healthy kidneys primarily exhibit an M2-like phenotype, but M1 macrophages predominate shortly after acute kidney injury and act to aggravate renal inflammation, while M2 macrophages play a major role in the eventual attenuation of inflammation and tissue repair response. Both tissue-resident and invasive macrophage generated upon the differentiation of circulating monocytes following their tissue infiltration participate in these responses29. Tubular epithelial cells (TECs) are the most populous cell type in the kidney and have key roles in pathological kidney injury45. Tubulointerstitial inflammation is a common characteristic of many types of acute and chronic kidney injury, and several studies have demonstrated that TEC-derived exosomes communicate with kidney-resident macrophages to cause kidney damage. For instance, miR-19b-3p in TEC-derived exosomes internalized by primary macrophages and macrophage cell lines are reported to induce M1 polarization and trigger kidney inflammation45. A second study indicated that macrophage internalization of exosomes from BSA-treated TECs led to an increased inflammatory response and macrophage migration46. This study also found that TEC-derived exosomes enriched in CCL2 mRNA activate macrophages to subsequently induce interstitial inflammation46. Similarly, miR-23a-containing exosomes released by TECs exposed to hypoxic conditions were found to induce M1 macrophage polarization and tubulointerstitial inflammation by promoting local inflammatory effects47. In combination, these reports indicate that AKI-related inflammation is substantially regulated by communication between TECs and kidney-resident macrophages where TEC-derived exosomes induce M1 macrophage polarization and inflammation to cause or promote tissue injury.\n\nInteractions between kidney-infiltrating macrophages and glomerular mesangial cells are also reported to promote kidney injury. Diabetes-associated chronic kidney inflammation is a consequence of the activation and proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells and the secretion of extracellular matrix and inflammatory cytokines in response to high glucose concentrations48. Exosomes from high glucose treated macrophages can transmit pro-inflammatory information between macrophages and glomerular mesangial cells48, and were found to activate kidney macrophages and accelerate kidney injury via the NF-κB P65 signaling pathway49. Thus, in tubulointerstitial inflammation-related kidney injury, TECs first release EVs to activate pro-inflammatory macrophages, while in diabetic nephropathy-related kidney injury, EVs secreted by pro-inflammatory macrophages induce pathological changes of glomerular mesangial cells. Both of these processes result in activation cascades which can develop into unchecked interaction loops. Approaches that employ modified small EVs to block the communication between macrophages and renal cells may thus prevent the development of renal tissue injury, and is worth further study.\n\n### Lung injury\n\nAlveolar macrophages (AMs), unlike from KCs and other tissue-resident macrophages, are not replenished by in situ differentiation of invasive monocytes, so the maintenance of AM abundance requires self-renewal6. During the development of acute lung injury (ALI), AMs are pivotal factors in both the initiation and resolution of inflammatory lung responses. AMs are found to constantly communicate with alveolar epithelial cells, with macrophage--epithelial cell crosstalk occurring via epithelial cells-derived EVs and their constituent miRNAs50, where epithelial cells can secrete small EVs to activate pro-inflammatory macrophages. For instance, caspase-3 enriched small MVs derived from lung epithelial cells activate AMs and mediate lung inflammatory responses involved in lung injury, and exposure to caspase-3-deficient MVs can interfere with macrophage activation and reduce lung inflammation51. Epithelial cell-derived MV expression of miR-221 and miR-320a is also responsible for triggering macrophage-mediated pro-inflammatory effects52. EVs released by lung epithelial cells into the alveolar cavity are primarily MVs, with a lesser amount of exosomes, and few apoptotic bodies51^{,}52. Similarly, macrophage-derived exosomes containing miR-155 and miR-146a induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in recipient epithelial cells to promote ALI progression53. Collectively, epithelial cell-derived MVs can promote macrophage-regulated lung inflammation, causing macrophage-derived EVs to continue to incite epithelial cell activation. Secreted interleukin (IL)-25 from lung epithelial cells can downregulate macrophage Rab27a and Rab27b expression, suppressing macrophage secretion of TNF-α-carrying exosomes and exosome-induced inflammatory effects54, in which alveolar\n\nTable 1 EV-mediated interactions between macrophages and tissue cells in tissue injury.",

These MVs were found to carry biologically active tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and play an important role in initiating ALI56. These MVs also contained miR-223 and miR-142 and were found to selectively target pulmonary macrophages57. Further study found that MVs released by AMs caused lung injury by activating the NLRP3 inflammatory pathway in adjacent macrophages57. Further, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid MVs loaded with miR-223/142 mimics were found to effectively target AMs and inhibit their activation and reduce lung inflammation57. Thus, using EVs to target the delivery of regulatory factors to pulmonary macrophages appears to represent a viable approach to prevent pulmonary injury in cases where there is an excessive inflammatory response, although it is possible that the opposite approach could be used in other conditions where a suboptimal inflammatory response was associated with chronic infection or other condition. EV-mediated interactions between macrophages and tissue cells in tissue injury are listed in\n\nTable 1 26, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57.\n\n### Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)",

        "text": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which primarily represent ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are generally considered to be immune homeostasis disorders affecting genetically susceptible individuals, and are characterized by prominent infiltration of the intestines by inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, T cells, macrophages and neutrophils58. At present, the precise etiology of IBD is still unclear. Macrophages, as the most significant components of the intestinal mononuclear phagocyte system, have received much attention in the study of IBD development. Studies indicate that intestinal macrophages, predominantly M1 macrophages, recruit circulating mononuclear cells and other myeloid\n\ncells into the intestinal tract by secreting the chemokines CCL7 and CCL8, and that these recruited monocytes mechanism have pro-inflammatory properties58. However, both tissue-resident and recruited macrophages play key roles in intestinal inflammation in IBD, as they serve as a major source of chemokines that trigger further recruitment of pro-inflammatory monocytes, release IL-1β and TNF-α to induce inflammatory response, disrupt the epithelial barrier, and induce epithelial cell apoptosis and drive intestinal inflammation58^{,}59. Thus, it has been proposed that attenuating monocyte recruitment or promoting M2 macrophage polarization could limit chronic inflammation in IBD. For example, the natural soya-based product genistein has been shown to promote M1 macrophages to adopt an M2 phenotype, and genistein treatment attenuates the severity of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis60. The induction of M2 macrophages in the intestinal tract was likely IL-10 and TLR4 dependent, given that the effect disappeared in IL-10-, TLR4-and MyD88-deficient mice61.\n\nMacrophages are thus likely to play a central role in IBD-related inflammation, and studies described below indicate that exosome stimulation is responsible for macrophage activation and polarization in IBD62. For example, RAW264.7 macrophages exhibited increases in M1 or M2 macrophage markers63, respectively, when treated with exosomes purified from the serum of DSS-induced or control C57BL/6 male mice. In-depth study found that serum exosomes of DSS-induced mice caused phosphorylation of p38 and ERK and TNF-α production62, and released TNF-α promoted M1 macrophage polarization to further aggravate the inflammatory response63. Small EVs with M1 polarizing activity are found in the peripheral circulation and the intestinal lumen of IBD patients, where small EVs are absorbed by intestinal macrophages, leading to increased IL-8 expression, the induction of M1 macrophage polarization, and ultimately colitis64. Polarization and stimulation of M1 macrophages by small EVs may thus be the major underlying mechanism behind propagation of local inflammation.\n\nExogenous administration of modified small EVs via the peripheral circulation may inhibit the polarization of M1 macrophages or increase the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages to alleviate inflammation. For example, Pediococcus pentosaceus, a gut-resident bacteria, secrete small membrane vesicles that can promote M2 macrophage polarization and the production of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and these vesicles have been shown to reduce colon inflammation in vivo and in vitro65. Several reports have also indicated that small EVs secreted by stem cells can also promote the M2 polarization of intestinal macrophages and alleviate colitis66, 67, 68. Finally, M2 macrophages also secrete small EVs that have therapeutic potential, since analysis of small EVs isolated from different M2 macrophage subtypes, found that M2b macrophage-derived exosomes could reduce the severity of DSS-induced colitis more effectively than those derived from M2a and M2c macrophages69. Following treatment with exosomes derived from M2b macrophages, mice with colitis revealed an increase in the number of anti-inflammatory regulatory T (Treg) cells and the level of IL-4 in their spleens, and significant suppression of key cytokines associated with colitis (IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-1β)69. In summary, these findings indicate that small EVs have potential to alter local or systematic macrophage M1/M2 macrophage balances and could thus represent an effective treatment strategy to alter and improve inflammation in IBD.\n\n### Aseptic inflammation: Pancreatitis\n\nAcute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas characterized by infiltration of a large number of inflammatory cells or inflammatory factors, leading to the amplification of local and systemic inflammation. M1 macrophage infiltration and activation is a critical step during development of AP70. Because NLRP3 inflammasome activity and NF-κB activation induce the M1 macrophage phenotype and cytokine production, it is possible that prevention of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization and inhibition of oxidative stress-induced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome responses in the pancreas could prevent or attenuate AP progression70.",

        "text": "Conversely, promoting M2 macrophage polarization could prevent AP or alleviate its inflammatory symptoms. After observing that carbon monoxide (CO) can modulate the macrophages to adopt an M2-like phenotype71, Taguchi et al.72 used nanotechnology-based CO-bound hemoglobin vesicles (CO-Hbv) to treat a mouse model of AP. They found that CO-Hbv treatment polarized macrophages toward an M2-like phenotype and inhibited neutrophil infiltration, eventually suppressing AP and pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury. Abdominal paracentesis drainage (APD) treatment has a beneficial effect on patients with severe AP before percutaneous catheter drainage, and Liu et al.73 determined that APD effect to improve the inflammatory environment of the peritoneal cavity in severe AP was mediated by polarizing peritoneal macrophages (PMs) towards the M2 phenotype, resulting in increased levels of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-4 and IL-10) and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and L-selectin). In combination, these studies demonstrate that M1 macrophages can promote AP development, whereas M2-polarized macrophages can alleviate AP inflammation. Modifying macrophage polarization may thus represent a promising treatment for AP.\n\nExosomes appear to play an important role in AP. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that culture medium from taurolithocholate-activated AR42J pancreatic acinar cells can enhance macrophage NF-κB activation, but this effect disappears when using a supernatant fraction that lacks exosomes74. These results indicate that exosomes from pancreatic acinar cells play a key role in activating pro-inflammatory macrophages in pancreatitis. Further, in an AP rat model, miR-155 in plasma exosomes was found to induce pro-inflammatory activity in macrophages75. Thus, both pancreatic acinar cell-derived exosomes and circulating exosomes can activate recipient macrophages. However, few in vivo studies have reported that pancreatic acinar cells affect the phenotype of tissue-resident pancreatic macrophages via the secretion of small EVs to influence pancreatitis development. However, it has been reported that exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cells can induce macrophages to adopt the M2 phenotype, which facilitates the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of pancreatic cancer cells76. MiR-501-3p expressed by M2 macrophage-derived exosomes can inhibit tumor suppressor TGFBR3 gene expression and facilitate the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by activating the TGF-β signaling pathway77. It is therefore possible that, as with pancreatic cancer, there are EVs derived by pancreatic acinar cells that can promote the development of pancreatitis by communicating with adjacent macrophages. However, unlike in\n\npancreatic cancer where M2 macrophages appear to promote cancer, M1 macrophages appear to promote pancreatitis77. Further research may be required and demonstrate the existence of an interaction loop between pancreatic cells and tissue-resident macrophages AP progression.\n\nSevere AP develops rapidly and often causes multiple organ dysfunction. ALI is the most common extra-pancreatic complication associated with severe AP, and it is believed that pulmonary macrophages are involved in pancreatitis-associated ALI by releasing inflammatory mediators and recruiting neutrophils. Sabrina et al.78 have reported that AMs promote early inflammatory responses, while interstitial macrophages help resolve inflammation, and M1-like AMs are the dominant population in non-resolving lung inflammation79. A series of tracking experiments have demonstrated that circulating exosomes effectively reach the alveolar compartment and were internalized by macrophages in an AP rat model to polarize AMs towards a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype80. Thus, circulating exosomes associated with AP appear to communicate with distant macrophages and to promote ALI via pro-inflammatory AM polarization.\n\n### Infection disease: Sepsis\n\nSepsis is a systemic inflammatory syndrome caused by an extreme response to pathogen-derived factors that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and potentially death. Since macrophages play an important role in preventing microbial infection and regulating inflammation, macrophage polarization is thought to be a key process in the pathogenesis of sepsis. In bacterial septicemia progression, M1-polarized macrophages phagocytose bacteria and generate a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote an innate immune response81, while in patients with severe sepsis, high circulating concentrations of M1-type cytokines correlate with increased mortality.\n\nApproaches designed to attenuate M1 macrophage activity or induce M1 to M2 macrophage polarization have been studied and deemed successful as potential sepsis treatments. For example, treatment of a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model with antibiotics and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that exhibit anti-inflammatory activity significantly attenuated CLP-induced bacterial sepsis, at least partially by inducing macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype82. This process was measured by evaluating the decreased numbers of M1 macrophages and increased numbers of M2 macrophages in the spleens of these septic mice, as well as the altered cytokine production of bone-marrow-derived macrophages from these mice, which included reductions in pro-inflammatory factors and increases in anti-inflammatory factors82. PMFA (5,7,30,40,50-pentamethoxyflavanone) treatment was also found to promote macrophages to shift from an M1 to an M2 phenotype via effects on STAT1/STAT6 signaling. Intraperitoneal administration of PMFA to LPS- or CLP-induced mouse models of sepsis, significantly increased mouse survival rates and dramatically decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels81.",

        "text": "Circulating small EVs have been demonstrated to contribute to systemic signaling and immunomodulation during sepsis. Moreover, these small EVs can induce M1 or M2 macrophage polarization to aggravate or improve sepsis-associated phenotypes. For example, when small EVs derived from the plasma from septic shock patients was injected into animal tissues, there was a marked increase in NF-κB activation and NO synthesis, demonstrating a pro-inflammatory effect83. Conversely, another experiment found that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells pretreated with interleukin-1β secreted miR-146a-containing exosomes that improved the phenotype of a mouse sepsis model by promoting M2 macrophage polarization84. Some EV-associated miRNAs are reported to regulate EV-induced cytokine production to contribute to pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotypes activated by circulating exosomes in sepsis85. In vitro experiment have also shown that endothelial cell cultures release small EVs that carry heat shock protein A12B (HSPA12B) and when these EVs are taken up by LPS-stimulated macrophages they increase IL-10 and decrease TNF-α and IL-1β production, while the loss of endothelial HSPA12B expression aggravates inflammatory responses during sepsis86. This data suggests that specific modifications to small EV cargoes affecting known functional proteins or miRNAs can generate modified EVs that can employed to promote pro-inflammatory or an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotypes.\n\nReducing macrophage secretion of small EVs or attenuating the uptake of these EVs could also have therapeutic potential. For instance, macrophages pre-treated with GW4869—an inhibitor of exosome biogenesis/release—and then challenged with LPS revealed impaired release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) compared to cells treated with LPS alone87, suggesting that blocking the secretion of macrophage-derived exosomes in sepsis could reduce macrophage-triggered inflammatory responses. Macrophage-derived nanoparticles can also demonstrate anti-inflammatory properties in sepsis to prolong survival, by reducing pro-inflammatory and increasing anti-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages to reduce endothelial cell inflammation88. Although there are several known mediators of septic inflammation that could be targeted to downregulate inflammatory responses, macrophages-derived exosomes appear to be the most studied and thus the most likely to serve as the basis for a short-term clinical application.\n\nSimilar to previously mentioned examples in AKI and ALI, sepsis can also cause systemic organ damage and like pancreatitis-induced ALI, the polarization of M1 AMs is reported to contribute to ALI development in sepsis. One study has reported that serum exosomes from mice with sepsis-related ALI can deliver miR-155 to macrophages to promote their M1 polarization, stimulate NF-κB activation, induce the production of TNF-α and IL-6, and eventually cause ALI89. Evidence also suggests that activated or M1-polarized macrophages isolated from animals with sepsis-related inflammation can act as important factors in the renal injury of AKI animal models44. M1 macrophages were found to be activated by heparin-binding protein (HBP) in sepsis-induced AKI, and heparin-induced suppression of HBP reduced M1 macrophage activation, TNF-α and IL-6 secretion, and the severity of renal injury90. However, to date no studies appear to have reported what signals or factors activate kidney macrophages, although EVs are promising candidates for this mechanism, and we anticipate that future studies will support this hypothesis.\n\n### Inflammatory-related metabolic disease: Obesity and diabetes\n\nObesity is associated with chronic activation of inflammatory pathways, and obesity-associated insulin resistance is a central mechanism in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes91^{,}92. Emerging evidence has shown that obesity-induced inflammation is a result of elevated levels of circulating pro-inflammatory\n\ncytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, which negatively affect the insulin signaling cascade to promote insulin resistance93. Adipose tissue macrophages are the principal source of these inflammatory factors in obesity. Macrophages present in adipose tissue of lean individuals primarily exhibit an M2 phenotype, while macrophages in adipose tissue of obese individuals predominantly demonstrate an M1 phenotype94. An alternative M2 activation state maintained by STAT6 and PPARs has been detected in adipose tissue, in contrast to a classical M1 activation state driven by AP1, NF-κB, and other signal-dependent transcription factors95. Chemokines and cytokines secreted by adipose cells induce the recruitment and polarization of macrophages, which are important mediators of cell crosstalk leading to inflammation in adipose tissues.",

        "text": "EVs also play important roles in intercellular communication in adipose tissue, however, especially when one considers that exosome miRNAs have the ability to regulate TGF-β and WNT/β-catenin signaling in obesity-induced inflammation96. Human adipocyte derived EVs are also reported to have immunomodulatory effects on macrophages, and macrophages pre-treated with human adipocyte-derived EVs secrete small EVs that interfere with adipocyte insulin signaling97. This demonstrates that there is a reciprocal regulatory loop between adipocytes and macrophages that is mediated by EVs and which affects macrophage activation and adipocyte insulin signaling that leads to adipose tissue inflammation98. This behavior is demonstrated in animal models, where adipocytes can release EVs which act as “find me” signals to promote macrophage migration and infiltration99. Additionally, miR-155 in adipocyte-derived MVs induces M1 macrophage polarization, causing chronic inflammation and local insulin resistance100. Adipocyte-secreted exosomes also transport miR-34a into macrophages, thereby suppressing M2 polarization by repressing the expression of KLF4101. Adipocyte-derived small EVs can therefore regulate macrophage infiltration and the adipose tissue M1/M2 macrophage ratio to induce obesity-related inflammation. Alteration of the disease-promoting balance between M1 and M2 adipose tissue macrophages can also contribute to the regulation of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance102. For example, Zhuge et al.103 used linaglipin, a strong DPP-4 inhibitor, to treat obesity, and found that it could reduce M1-polarized macrophage migration while inducing an M2-dominant macrophage shift within white adipose and liver tissues, thereby attenuating obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.\n\nComplementary to adipocyte mechanisms to activate macrophages, activated macrophages not only secrete inflammatory cytokines that provoke systemic and local inflammation but also release EVs to influence adipocyte activity. Exosomes from LPS-activated macrophages upregulate some of the pathways and metabolic processes related to inflammation onset in adipocytes20. These exosomes also exhibit increased levels of miR-29a, which can be transferred into hepatocytes, myocytes and adipocytes to impair the insulin sensitivity of these target cells in vitro and in vivo, ultimately promoting obesity-induced insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes104. These results indicate that activated macrophages participate in a variety of inflammation-related metabolic pathways by releasing small EVs that promote local and systemic chronic inflammation. Altering the polarization of macrophages and thus the cargoes and activities of their small EVs may improve macrophage-mediated inflammation. Melatonin serves as an example for the potential of such an approach, since it alleviates adipose inflammation both by direct actions on adipocytes and indirect activity on macrophages mediate by adipocyte-derived EVs105.\n\nCirculating EVs can thus polarize M1 macrophages to secrete small EVs that trigger pro-inflammatory responses (Fig. 3) associated with acute inflammatory responses (AP, AKI, ALI, and sepsis) that can resolve with supportive care or short-term interventions and non-resolving, chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, obesity and diabetes) that are more difficult to attenuate and regress. Small EVs can, however, also carry protein and miRNA cargoes that limit attenuate acute inflammation and promote tissue repair or limit inflammation and tissue damage during chronic inflammation conditions. Better understanding of the roles that EVs play in regulating the polarization and exerting the regulatory effects of macrophages during the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses and conditions may identify new therapeutic targets for intervention to limit excessive tissue injury. Approaches that target EV-mediated mechanisms involved in these processes may be more effective in limiting inflammation and tissue injury and have fewer side effects than approaches that attempt to attenuate macrophage accumulation or activity.\n\n## MSC EVs promote macrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype",

        "text": "Given the ability of M2 macrophages to limit inflammation and tissue injury, several studies have examined the potential of different methods to stimulate M2 macrophages to release anti-inflammatory mediators in vitro and in vivo. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have recently shown great potential as an alternative means to treat inflammatory disorders due to their immunomodulatory characteristics106, 107, 108. MSCs are mesodermal cells that can differentiate into chondrocytes, osteocytes, and adipocytes in vitro, and are present in multiple tissues including the umbilical cord, muscle, adipose and bone marrow109^{,}110. While MSC-based products have been used in several clinical trials, various problems such as low transplanted cell viability, immunogenicity, poor homing to desired tissues, and safety issues have prevented MSCs from being used in clinical applications107^{,}111. More recent research has therefore shifted from the use of MSCs to the use of MSC-derived EVs, which can effectively transfer MSC-derived functional molecules to target cells without the issues associated with direct MSC transfer. For example, the secreted apoptotic bodies from MSC carry the immunoregulatory factors of MSC, which are taken up by target cells by endocytosis or membrane fusion, and MVs or exosomes exert biological effects in a paracrine and endocrine manner112. Clinical trials have found that MSC-derived small EVs may offer specific advantages when compared to MSC cells due to their lower immunogenicity and greater safety profile, and MSC-EVs administration is also less likely to suffer from the pulmonary first pass effect109^{,}113. More importantly, MSC-EVs have shown great potential in promoting M2 macrophage polarization in inflammatory related diseases113.\n\n### Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)\n\nBone marrow stromal cell (BMSC)-derived small EVs (BMSC-EVs) have been reported to reduce colonic inflammation by downregulating inflammatory responses and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. The beneficial effects of BMSC EVs are blocked by macrophage depletion, indicating that BMSC EVs exert anti-\n\nEV-mediated interactions in inflammatory environments.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\nFigure 3 M1 macrophage EV interactions in inflammatory diseases affecting different tissues. EVs in the peripheral circulation carry miR-155 that activates p38/ERK signaling pathways and M1 macrophage polarization. M1 macrophage EVs (M1-EVs) demonstrate multiple pro-inflammatory effects, as they: induce proinflammatory IL-  $1\\beta$  and TNF- $\\alpha$  secretion in colon tissue, and endothelial dysfunction, to promote inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); activate NF- $\\kappa$ B and NLRP3 signaling in acinar cells to induce acute pancreatitis (AP); target lung and kidney tissues to induce acute lung injury (ALI) and kidney injury (AKI); carry miR-34a, which upregulates TGF- $\\beta$  and WNT/ $\\beta$ -catenin signaling in adipocytes to promote in insulin resistance (IR). Colon cells and adipocytes experiencing inflammatory conditions also release EVs that can promote macrophage polarization to pro-inflammatory phenotypes.\n\ninflammatory through colonic macrophages $^{114}$ . Similarly, in an achilles tendon rupture model, Chamberlain et al. $^{115}$  found that exosomes derived from macrophages exposed to BSMC exosomes (BSMC-Exo) promoted more regenerative healing responses than BSMC-Exo. In a second tendon rupture model study, local administration of BMSC-Exo at the injury site was also found to promote the formation of fibrocartilage by increasing M2 macrophage polarization and decreasing M1 macrophage levels, with beneficial effects on tissue repair and biomechanical properties at the injury site $^{111}$ . Finally, in myocardial ischemia mouse model, intramyocardial injection of BMSC-Exo could reduce infarct size, and its effects have been confirmed by modifying the polarization of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages $^{116,117}$ . These examples illustrate that BMSC-Exo and BMSC-EV have broad effects to attenuate inflammation and promote tissue repair through M2 macrophage-dependent mechanisms.\n\nBMSCs possess some characteristics of immune cells and short-term memory of environmental signals, as one group has demonstrated by showing that BSMC exhibit improved therapeutic efficacy in promoting skin flap survival after being pretreated with  $\\mathrm{LPS}^{118}$ . This discovery poses question of whether small EVs secreted by LPS-treated BMSCs have improved anti-inflammatory properties. A study by Ti et al. $^{119}$  has reported that BSMC-Exo obtained after BSMCs were pre-conditioned with LPS (LPS-BSMC-Exo) were better than BMSC-Exo from untreated BSMCs at modulating the balance between macrophage phenotypes and promoting M2 macrophage activation due to their upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and that the let-7b/\n\nTLR4 pathway plays a critical role in this activity. Similarly, in an in vitro mouse model of myocardial injury, LPS-BSMC-Exo had superior therapeutic effects to attenuate post-infarction inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by regulating macrophage polarization than did BMSC-Exo from untreated cells $^{116}$ . These studies indicate that low concentration LPS-BMSC-Exo administration may be an alternative to BMSC therapy as cell-free treatment strategy to induce M2 macrophages.\n\nBMSC-EV exposure should, in theory, be capable of inducing both M1 and M2 macrophage polarization. The literature we retrieved for this review indicated only that BMSC-EV promoted the polarization and activity of M2 macrophages. However, it is possible that pre-treatment of BSMCs with alternate stimuli could alter BSMC-Exo cargoes to promote pro-inflammatory responses in recipient cells, and is worth investigation.",

Adipose stem cells\n\nAlthough BMSC-derived small EVs are reported useful in tissue repair and disease treatment, the BSMC isolation procedure is complex and painful $^{120}$ .

Evidence suggests that adipose tissue can provide up to 500-fold more MSCs than an equivalent amount of bone marrow aspirate, and ADSCs have therefore emerged as a stable source of MSCs due to their greater relative abundance, high yield upon isolation, ease of collection via a less invasive procedure that has fewer ethical\n\nTable 2 Macrophage polarization effects of EVs derived from stem cell from different tissue sources.\n\n|  MSC source | Stimulus | Species; model | Macrophage polarization effect | Effects/mechanism | Therapeutic effect | Ref.  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Bone marrow | No | Mouse; IBD (DSS & TNBS induced) | M2b macrophage polarization | Induction of IL-10 production | Suppressed inflammatory responses | 114  |\n|  Bone marrow | No | Mouse; Achilles tendon rupture | M2 macrophage polarization | Increase the number of endothelial cells and reduce type I collagen | Improved mechanical function & angiogenesis; reduced inflammation | 115  |\n|  Bone marrow | LPS | Mouse; myocardial infarction | M2 macrophage polarization | Depress NF-κB signaling pathway and activate AKT1/AKT2 signaling pathway | Reduced post-infarction cardiomyocyte apoptosis & inflammation | 116  |\n|  Bone marrow | No | Mouse; myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury | M2 macrophage polarization | miR-183 targeting of the TLR4 pathway | Reduced infarct size & inflammation | 117  |\n|  Bone marrow | LPS | Rat; diabetic cutaneous wound healing | M2 macrophage activation | Let-7b regulation of the TLR4/NF-κB/STAT3/AKT signaling pathway | Reduced inflammation & enhance cutaneous wound healing | 119  |\n|  Adipose tissue | No | Mouse; Obesity | M2 macrophage polarization | Arginase-1 activation of STAT3 transcription. | Greater insulin sensitivity & reduced adipose inflammation & obesity | 123  |\n|  Adipose tissue | No | Mouse; Aspergillus protease-treated MLE12 epithelial cells | M2 macrophage activation | Reduce eotaxin and IL-25, increase TGF-β and IL-10 | Reduced Th2-mediated inflammation | 125  |\n|  Adipose tissue | miR-30d-5p mimic | Rat; acute ischemic stroke | Promote M2 microglia/macrophage polarization | Suppress autophagy | Reduced cerebral injury area following infarction | 126  |\n|  Adipose tissue | LPS and D-galactosamine | Macrophages | Suppress M1 macrophage activation | miR-17 suppression of TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway | Reduce inflammatory factor secretion | 127  |\n|  Adipose tissue | No | Mouse; ovalbumin-induced asthma | M1 to M2 macrophage conversion | miR-183-5p sponging to enhance FoxO1-mediated M2 macrophage activation | Reduced airway remodeling | 128  |\n|  Human umbilical cord tissue | No | Mouse; spinal cord injury | Drive BMDM from M1 to M2 polarization | Inflammatory cytokine downregulation | Improved resolution of spinal cord injury | 135  |\n|  Human umbilical cord tissue | No | Rat; burn healing | Inhibit secretion of pro-inflammatory factors | miR-181c downregulation of TLR4 signaling pathway | Reduced burn-induced inflammation | 136  |\n|  Human umbilical cord tissue | IL-6 | Mouse; chemically induced liver injury | Inhibit macrophage activation and cytokine production | miR-455-3p targeting of PI3K signaling | Reduced macrophage infiltration & improved liver histology | 137  |\n|  Human umbilical cord tissue | No | Mouse; acute liver injury | ND | Reduced inflammation | Accelerated resolution of acute liver injury | 138  |\n|  Human umbilical cord tissue | No | Mouse; acute liver injury & LPS-stimulated | Inhibit activation of the NLRP3 pathway | Reduced expression of the NLRP3 | Enhanced liver tissue repair | 139  |\n\nEV-mediated interactions in inflammatory environments.\n\n|   |  | RAW264.7 macrophages |  | inflammasome and its regulated inflammatory factors |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Human umbilical cord tissue | TNF-α | Mouse; acute liver injury & LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages | Inhibit activation of the NLRP3 pathway | miRNA-299-3p reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway | Reduced liver damage | 140  |\n|  Periodontal ligament | LPS | THP-1 macrophages | M1 macrophage polarization | Increased expression of M1-associated cytokines | M1 macrophage polarization | 141  |\n\nIBD, Inflammatory bowel diseases; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenenesulfonic acid solution; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ND, not described; BMDMs, bone marrow derived macrophages.",

        "text": "issues $^{120,121}$ . Due to the relatively simple procedure involved in ASDC isolation their ability of SADCs to differentiate into other tissue types of the mesoderm (e.g., bone, cartilage and muscle), ADSCs have been studied in and proven useful in a wide variety of applications $^{122}$ , such as potential therapies for arthritis, colitis, and autoimmune diabetes $^{123}$ . ADSCs have shown the same immunoregulation and regeneration capabilities as other MSCs, and small EVs secreted by ADSCs (ADSC-EV) appear to exert the same functions as ADSCs.\n\nADSC-EV, like BMSC-EV, has been found to promote the polarization and activation of M2 macrophages. Exosomes derived from ADSCs reduce adipose inflammation and obesity by interacting with macrophages to induce anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes, in which activated M2 macrophages exert immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects[123,124]. ADSC-EVs have also been shown to promote the polarization and activation of M2 macrophages to ameliorate inflammation in lung epithelial cells treated with an inflammatory factor[125]. While the mechanisms responsible for the activity of ADSC-EVs are not fully understood, one study indicates that the ability of these EVs to induce M2 macrophage polarization and limit inflammatory responses is mediated by inhibiting autophagy, a process that may shift macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype[126].\n\nSeveral proteins and miRNAs in ADSC-derived exosomes can also activate M2 macrophage signaling pathways. For example, miR-17-enriched EVs secreted by ADSCs can suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation by targeting TXNIP to contribute to the reduction in inflammatory factors secreted by macrophages[127]. Further, reduced expression of regulatory factors in target cells and tissue that leads to inflammation can be countered by the administration of modified ADSC-EVs that carry these factors. Lung tissue of asthmatic mice exhibits a marked downregulation of the circular RNA mmu_circ_0001359 and treatment of asthmatic mice with ADSC-EVs loaded with this RNA has been reported to reduce airway remodeling and promote the polarization of AM to an M2 phenotype to reduce the release of inflammatory factors[128]. In another example, tissue from the brains of patients and animals exposed to acute ischemic shock was found to exhibit reduced expression of microRNA miR-30d-5p, while treatment with ADSC-EVs produced by ADSCs expressing an miR-30d-5p mimic vector could effectively promote the M2 polarization of microglia and reduce the cerebral injury area at the site of infarction[126]. These studies indicate that ADSC can be readily modified in vitro to express small RNAs to produce EVs with therapeutic effects. Similar direct therapeutic approaches may also be possible for other inflammatory conditions where the downregulation of specific factors lead to enhanced, aberrant or dysregulated inflammation. Due to the high abundance of ADSCs in their source tissue relative to other MSCs, and the relative simplicity of the isolation and extraction processes required to produce ADSC isolates, ADSCs are likely to become the primary source of anti-inflammatory EVs employed to promote M2 macrophage polarization in the treatment of inflammatory disease when and such applications are approved for therapeutic applications.\n\n# 4.3. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs)\n\nMSCs derived from the human umbilical cord (HUCMSCs) can be obtained from the amniotic membrane, cord-lining, Wharton's jelly, or peri-vascular region[129]. HUCMSCs are isolated using a\n\nQian Hu et al.\n1506\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\nFigure 4 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from bone marrow, and adipose and umbilical cord tissue induce M2 macrophage polarization via specific miRNA cargoes to regulate an anti-inflammatory effects.\n\npainless collection procedure and have rapid self-renewal properties, unlike BMSCs $^{129}$ . In addition, pre-clinical trials have found that HUCMSCs applications have fewer side effects and are generally safer than other MSC treatments $^{129}$ . Thus, HUCMSCs are a promising source of MSCs due to their relative abundance, non-invasive collection, convenient and inexpensive isolation procedure, low immunogenicity and high gene transfection efficiency $^{130}$ . Evidence shows that HUCMSCs exert their therapeutic effects primarily through EV-mediated paracrine effects. In many cases of inflammation-related diseases and tissue damage repair $^{110,131}$ , HUCMSC EVs exhibit all of the advantages of HUCMSCs without their disadvantages, and are easier to maintain in a bioactive state during storage and transport $^{132}$ . HUCMSC EVs are acquired by extensive in vitro expanding HUCMSCs; are convenient to extract, store and transport; and exhibit lower immunogenicity and better biocompatibility than other macrophage-polarizing exosomes $^{133}$ . Multiple studies have now shown that HUCMSC EVs exhibit strong potential for use in \"cell-free therapy\" approaches $^{110}$ .",

        "text": "HUCMSC EVs are reported to reduce inflammation by targeting macrophages, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and enhancing the recruitment of M2 macrophages to several organs and tissues, including the islets, liver, fat, and muscle[134]. HUCMSC exosomes have been shown to effectively trigger bone marrow-derived macrophages to undergo a shift from M1 to M2 polarization in vitro, to possess characteristic anti-inflammatory effects, and to improve functional recovery in mice with spinal cord injuries by downregulating inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF- $\\alpha$ , MIP-1 $\\alpha$ , IL-6 and IFN- $\\gamma$ [135]). Systemic administration of HUCMSC exosomes has also been shown to reverse inflammation related to burn injuries in rats, by limiting macrophage-based inflammatory reactions[136]. HUCMSC exosome miR-181c played a pivotal role in attenuating burn-associated inflammation in this study, since HUCMSC exosomes that overexpressed miR-181c were more effective at suppressing TLR4 signaling in burned rats to reduce inflammation[136]. Similarly, another group examined\n\nthe ability of HUCMSC exosome miR-455-3p, which was induced by IL-6 treatment, to inhibit IL-6 signaling by suppressing PI3K expression $^{137}$ , and found that miR-455-3p-enriched exosomes inhibited LPS-challenged macrophage activation and cytokine production. Thus, like ADSCs cells, it is feasible to modify HUCMSCs in vitro to obtain EVs enriched in specific regulatory miRNAs for targeted treatment of selected inflammatory conditions.\n\nHUCMSCs, unlike BMSCs and ADSCs, have innate hepatogenic properties, however, and HUCMSC therapy can be used to directly treat acute liver injury without requiring that HUCSCmcs undergo differentiation or manipulation prior to their administration $^{138}$ , raising the question as to whether or not unmodified HUCMSC EVs exhibit similar tissue repair activity. One study has reported that unmodified HUCMSC exosomes can indeed efficiently accumulate in the liver to alleviate acute liver failure by reducing macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activity $^{139}$ . However, a second study has shown that exosomes derived from HUCMSC treated with TNF- $\\alpha$  exhibit enhanced therapeutic effects to attenuate liver damage $^{140}$ , finding that miRNA-299-3p is upregulated in TNF- $\\alpha$ -stimulated HUCMSCs and selectively packaged into exosomes to exert anti-inflammatory functions in exosome treatments $^{140}$ . Thus, HUCMSC-EVs appear to have a unique advantage for the treatment of liver inflammation and injury.\n\nHUCMSC exosomes have also been reported to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and modulate the activation of microglia in mouse brains to alleviate neuroinflammation $^{131}$ , which is a critical advantage for exosome-based applications intended to treat neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological pathologies, since the blood-brain barrier poses a formidable barrier for most therapeutic approaches.\n\nMost stem cells appear to produce EVs that can promote anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization, regardless of whether the stem cells derive from bone marrow, adipose, or umbilical cord tissue, and LPS-pretreatment of many of these cells has been\n\nreported to enhance the anti-inflammatory activity of their EVs. However, one report indicates that LPS-pretreated periodontal ligament stem cells secrete small EVs that can induce M1 macrophage polarization141. Various therapeutic effects mediated by stem cell derived EVs on macrophage polarization are listed in the following Table 2114, 115, 116, 117^{,}119^{,}123^{,}125, 126, 127, 128^{,}135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141. The ability of stem cells and their EVs to induce M1 or M2 macrophage polarization may thus depend on the source tissue and original microenvironment of the stem cells, which may affect their relative differentiation state, as well as conditions and stimuli these cells encounter during isolation and cell culture expansion. The ability of MSC EVs to promote M2 macrophage polarization appears to have significant potential utility for applications designed to attenuate inflammatory conditions and promote tissue repair, however, there is also a concern for potential negative consequences due to off-target treatment effects. For example, M2 macrophages present within a tumor microenvironment can accelerate tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis, and MSC EV administration during non-small cell lung cancer has been shown promoting the growth and mobility of cancer cells by polarizing M2 macrophages142.\n\nStrategies that employ EVs isolated from different MSCs to induce M2 macrophage polarization to limit tissue inflammation and promote tissue repair (Fig. 4) have been attempted for various inflammatory disease conditions. MSC-derived EVs can promote AMs to adopt M2 phenotypes and attenuate tissue damage in clinically relevant lung injury models143, and to reduce hypoxia-ischemic injury in neonatal mice by modulating microglia/macrophage polarization144. HUCMSCs seem to be the best overall source of anti-inflammatory EVs among the MSCs discussed herein for the reasons listed above. EVs of each of these MSC types, however, have shown considerable ability to inhibit tissue inflammation and injury, and their relative merits as therapeutic approaches designed to treat specific inflammatory conditions should be carefully considered in future studies.\n\n## Potential application of macrophage-derived EVs for inflammatory disease treatment",

        "text": "Conventional drug-loaded nanoparticles have, to a degree, demonstrated potential utility for infectious disease treatment, but such nanoparticles are often difficult to manufacture, can be rapidly cleared from the circulation by the mononuclear phagocyte system, and may cause undesirable side effects such as organ toxicity and the activation of immune responses145, 146, 147. Decorating nanoparticles with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) corona is thus sometimes used to reduce the recognition of nanoparticles by the mononuclear phagocyte system to avoid their rapid clearance from the circulation. However, small EVs have emerged as a better means for drug delivery than PEGylated nanoformulations, due to the low immunogenicity, high biocompatibility, and high efficacy of these EVs22, although exosome PEGylation can also reduce mononuclear phagocyte system recognition after administration to mice to improve their time in circulation147. Small EVs contain a variety of adhesion molecules with their lipid bilayer that can interact with cell membrane factors to promote their interaction and uptake by specific cell types, and thus small EVs can have specific cell tropisms according to their surface display of specific adhesion molecules, which is reflective of their specific cell origin145. Nanoparticles are usually of abiotic origin, however, and thus lack these cell interaction mechanisms. Studies have also indicated that small EVs are taken up by their recipient cells about 30 times more efficiently than synthetic nanoparticles145. This suggests that drugs loaded into small EVs can be more efficiently delivered to target cells at therapeutic quantities, demonstrating a major advantage of small EVs-based drug delivery systems over common synthetic nanocarriers. Taken together, these characteristics imply that small EVs-based treatment approaches are likely to be more effective than those that employ synthetic nanoparticles.\n\nMany challenges still need to be solved to allow the clinical translation of approaches that employ small EVs for therapeutic applications, especially for infectious disease applications. First, standard procedures for small EV isolation must be established to allow the consistent isolation of high purity small EV preparations. Several methods are currently used for small EV isolation, including immunoaffinity, density gradient, and ultracentrifugation isolation approaches, but each method has drawbacks that limit utility for clinical applications19. For example, immunoaffinity separations have low recovery rates; density gradient procedures are labor-intensive and are not amenable to automation; and ultracentrifugation approaches are time-consuming19^{,}22, while the performance of commercial kits requires further improvement. Small EV isolation methods thus require additional improvement to allow consistent large-scale isolation of high-purity EVs that will be required for clinical applications.\n\nSecond, additional studies are required to determine which cells (e.g. macrophages or MSCs) are the most appropriate source for the small EVs used in a therapeutic application, which may vary by the specific application. Small EVs tend to have characteristics of their parent cells. EVs derived from M1 macrophages have elevated potential to activate inflammatory responses via boosting a Th1 and Th17 response, while EVs derived from M2 macrophages are generally able to attenuate inflammation via a mechanism bypassing a Th1 and Th17 response148, while small EVs secreted by MSCs have been shown to suppress pro-inflammatory responses and stimulate cell proliferation in clinical trials for several diseases149. Approaches employing all these small EVs have lower therapeutic risk and superior safety profiles than cell-based therapy approaches employing their parental cells150^{,}151. Beyond their ability to mediate pro- or anti-inflammatory responses, small EVs derived from these different cell types may exhibit distinct cell targeting capacities or other functionalities. Macrophages secrete exosomes that express CD47 receptors that interact with signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) to produce a “don't eat me” signal upon their interaction with phagocytes147. Macrophage-derived exosomes express intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), enhancing their interaction with blood--brain barrier endothelial cells152 and transit through the blood--brain barrier. Similarly, the innate ability of HUCMSC EVs to accumulate in the liver and attenuate hepatic tissue inflammation may make them the best candidates for small EV therapeutics when designing applications to treat liver inflammation and injury.\n\nFinally, the ability to modify the cargoes of small therapeutic EVs by loading small molecules may represent an additional consideration. Many different approaches have been described to load small molecules into EVs, either directly or indirectly, including electroporation, sonication, incubation19, and these exhibit different loading efficiencies, and may cause off-target effects22. Go et al.153 have achieved remarkable results in the treatment of inflammation induced by Gram-negative bacteria by loading dexamethasone into monocyte-derived EVs by sonication, illustrating that it is feasible to directly load antibiotics directly into macrophages-derived EVs to produce effective therapeutics",

        "text": "for infectious disease treatment. In a related study, Yang et al.154 used an incubation approach to load the antibiotic linezolid into exosomes derived from mouse RAW264.7 macrophages, and found that this exosome-encapsulated linezolid formulation had a better inhibitory effect on intracellular methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in vitro and in vivo that direct linezolid treatment, without any sign of macrophage cytotoxicity. These studies indicate that antibiotic-loaded macrophage-derived small EVs may be more effective therapeutics than direct treatment, particularly for intracellular microbial infections. Macrophage-derived EVs may be particularly useful for such applications, since macrophage cell lines can serve as stable sources of small EV preparations and are amenable to manipulations that promote the selective delivery of specific therapeutic molecules to desired target cells or tissues, while the inherent anti-inflammatory properties of such EVs may amplify desired therapeutic effects.\n\nFinally, differences in stimuli encountered during cell isolation or culture or EV processing can alter the characteristics and function of small EV preparations produced from the same tissues or cells. Strictly controlling the consistency of small EVs therefore requires considerable attention to detail, and may be especially challenging when using stem cell populations. Additional studies are required to establish standardized procedures for EV isolation and manipulation for the various cell types under investigation. Further experiments are also needed to verify the roles of these EVs in specific processes pertaining to various categories of inflammatory disease.\n\n## Conclusion and perspectives\n\nThis review summarizes the specific effects of macrophages, MSCs and their small EVs in several inflammatory disease conditions, particularly in regard to inflammatory responses that lead to local or remote tissue damage, and how EV-based interaction loops between pro-inflammatory macrophages and tissues play a vital role in disease progression. Evidence now indicates that altering the interactions between macrophages and their target cells in tissues affected by inflammatory conditions via administration of native or exogenously modified EVs preparations can be a promising approach to attenuate tissue inflammation and injury. Consideration must be paid to the relative stage of the tissue injury/repair process or the severity of the inflammatory response, however, since both pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage activities are required at different stages of the resolution of infection or tissue injury. In the early stages of some inflammatory responses, M1 macrophages release regulatory factors and recruit cells required to initiate innate and adaptive immune responses to limit and resolve local infections, while later in such infections or during injury responses M2 macrophages are needed promote tissue repair by limiting inflammation, clearing cell debris, and promoting the cell proliferation to replace cell deficits. Small EVs secreted by MSCs mentioned in this paper can polarize M2 macrophages, and EVs released by these cells have been shown to have important actions in the resolution of inflammatory responses and tissue repair, and may serve as therapeutics to improve the control of dysregulated or excessive inflammation that may cause tissue injury.\n\nSeveral questions remain to be answered about the potential small EV therapeutics, including the best time to employ them and what their side effects may be when used in different situations.\n\nOver-activation of M1 macrophages is expected to promote systemic inflammatory responses, potentially including atherosclerosis155. M2 macrophages appear to be the “default” form for most tissue-resident macrophages, and appear to be required to control systemic inflammation. However, M2 macrophage EVs can also facilitate tumor progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion156. Thus, the decision to use potential future EV applications to resolve inflammatory conditions or treat certain infections will need to consider multiple factors to achieve maximum efficacy and reduce potential side effects.\n\nIn addition to these considerations, further studies are also required to establish standardized conditions for EV isolation and modification procedures, since such differences may alter the characteristics and innate functionality of therapeutic small EV preparations. Macrophage-derived EVs appear to have potential as drug carriers for the treatment of infectious disease. However, similar studies have not yet demonstrated that such EVs can be used to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to attenuate inflammatory disease conditions, although this is likely to be future applications, particularly when considering the innate anti-inflammatory characteristics of M2 macrophages within the topic aseptic inflammation.\n\nTony Y.

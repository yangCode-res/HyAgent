# Abstract

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as key agents for weight management, based on their marked efficacy as observed in randomized controlled trials. While still limited, real-world studies on GLP-1RA use in populations with obesity are increasingly available. This narrative review discusses contemporary real-world evidence demonstrating the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the currently approved GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The observed weight reduction in clinical practice overall tends to be lower than in randomized controlled trials; however, outcomes approach those seen in trials when focusing on highly adherent patients. Real-world studies demonstrate high discontinuation rates of GLP-1RAs  $(20\% - 50\%)$  within the first year, and the use of much lower doses than those evaluated in clinical trials. Evidence from observational studies within type 2 diabetes or obesity populations suggests frequent gastrointestinal disturbances in GLP-1RA users, as also observed in trials, but no clear increase in risks of severe events like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, thyroid disorders, or depression and self-harm. Further evidence is needed to understand possible real-world associations of GLP-1RAs with eye disease and other rare outcomes. We provide 10 areas of particular importance for further research on GLP-1RA within the real-world space, including improved understanding of the exact drivers of early discontinuation and suboptimal dosing, studies of the effects of stopping GLP-1RA treatment, and investigations of clinical and cost-effectiveness for hard clinical outcomes in real-world settings, including not only cardio-reno-metabolic outcomes but also obesity-induced diseases like neuropsychiatric disease, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and infections.

# Plain Language Summary

Recent advancements in weight-loss medications have sparked a lot of interest. The so-called GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (GLP-1RAs) have gained a lot of attention, because they have shown to be very effective, leading to significant weight loss

in patients participating in clinical trials. GLP‐1RAs, like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, help manage weight by mimicking hormones that control blood sugar and appetite. However, how these medications perform in real life can be different from the controlled settings of clinical trials, in which patients are carefully selected and their treatment plans closely followed. This literature review looks at how these medications are used and their effectiveness and safety in real‐world settings. In real‐life practice, GLP‐1RAs are often less effective than in clinical trial conditions. This is usually because patients don't follow their medication plans as strictly as in trials. Real‐world data shows that many patients use lower doses and do not stick to their treatment as strictly as participants in a controlled trial might, leading to less weight loss. However, those who do follow their plans closely can achieve results similar to those in trials. A major issue with GLP‐1RAs is that many patients stop using them within the first year due to side effects or high costs of the medications, especially if not covered by insurance. Common side effects include nausea and digestive problems, which are the main reasons patients stop taking these treatments. These side effects are often manageable and decrease over time, and this reviews found no strong real‐world evidence that GLP‐1RAs cause severe side effects in many users. Despite these challenges, when GLP‐1RAs are used effectively and consistently, they show substantial benefits in weight loss, most so the newest medications semaglutide and tirzepatide. These medications are also likely to help manage and prevent weight‐related health conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but evidence for these beneficial outcomes is still scarce in real‐world settings. The review emphasizes the need for more research to understand why many patients stop using these medications and how to improve dosing. It also calls for studies on the long‐term effects of these therapies on various health outcomes, including mental health, cardiometabolic health, cancer, and rare conditions like eye diseases. Overall, while GLP‐1RAs are a valuable tool for weight management, their real‐world use requires careful consideration of individual patient factors, such as the ability to stick to treatment plans, manage side effects, and afford the medications. Further research will help make these treatments more effective for a wider range of people that need them.

## INTRODUCTION

The global prevalence of obesity has reached alarming levels, with significant implications for public health.1, 2, 3 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1 billion people worldwide are now affected by obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30.4 Obesity is associated with numerous comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, sleep apnoea and other respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, mental illness and many types of cancer, which collectively contribute to increased morbidity and mortality and a huge economic burden associated with obesity.5, 6

Traditional weight‐loss strategies, such as lifestyle behavioural interventions, often yield only limited weight loss and struggle to maintain a clinically relevant weight loss over time.7, 8 Consequently, there is considerable interest in new approaches to achieve and maintain substantial weight loss, including emerging pharmacological options.9, 10 Among these, incretin hormone‐based drugs, first and foremost glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA),11

have emerged as a pivotal treatment option for managing both obesity and T2D.12, 13, 14, 15 A surge in the use of GLP‐1RA has thus occurred in many countries over the last 3--4 years, even leading to periods of global supply shortage.16 As of early 2025, GLP‐1RA marketed for the management of obesity include liraglutide, semaglutide, and the newer dual GLP‐1RA and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist (GIP‐RA) tirzepatide,8 while a range of new single, dual and triple hormone agonists are currently under development.14

The three GLP‐1RA‐based agents currently approved for weight loss have all shown clear efficacy in promoting weight loss in randomized controlled trials (RCTs),17, 18, 19 that is, in settings with good medication adherence among participants and a follow‐up of typically one to two years.15 In contrast, evidence on their long‐term effects and hard clinical outcomes in broad populations with obesity in real‐world clinical practice is still limited, and comparably little is known about the utilization patterns and clinical effects on both weight loss and associated comorbidities of these newer medications in the population‐based setting.7, 14, 20, 21

The goal of this narrative review is to summarize available evidence from real‐world observational studies on the utilization patterns, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the three currently approved GLP‐1RA for weight loss, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The review briefly discusses contemporary real‐world data on drug utilization and then focuses on evidence on clinical outcomes in routine care settings, including weight loss, other clinical outcomes and adverse effects. We focus mainly on larger observational epidemiological studies, with a prioritization of studies conducted in obese populations (if available), and secondarily in T2D populations, to ensure the relevance, robustness and timeliness of the data. Further, we highlight unmet research needs and potential future directions in the study of the real‐world effects of these novel weight‐loss medications.

## METHODS

### Search strategy

To identify relevant studies for this literature review, a search was conducted across PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The search strategy employed a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to obesity, pharmacological weight‐loss therapies, drug utilization and safety, clinical effects, and cost‐effectiveness. Keywords included ‘obesity/drug therapy', ‘body weight', ‘overweight', ‘weight loss,' ‘anti‐obesity agents', ‘incretins', ‘glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists', ‘epidemiologic studies', ‘systematic review', ‘pharmacoepidemiology', ‘health services research', ‘drug utilization', ‘treatment adherence and compliance', ‘adverse effects', ‘prognosis' and ‘treatment outcome'. Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used to refine the search results. Searches were run in January 2025 and limited to studies published in English until 15 January 2025. A hand search of the bibliographies of eligible publications was also undertaken to identify any relevant studies that were not found by the original search.

Priority was given to evidence obtained from recent observational epidemiologic studies (case series, cohort, case--control and cross‐sectional studies), preferably of more than a few hundred individuals. We prioritized studies of GLP‐1RA‐based drug use in populations with obesity, but we also assessed prior systematic literature reviews and recent large studies of GLP‐1RA use in populations with T2D, as evidence for various outcomes is still scarce for populations with obesity. Where relevant, we compared the observational evidence with that of meta‐analyses of GLP‐1RA RCTs or major individual RCTs. Data extraction included study characteristics (e.g. author, year, country), study populations and data sources, study type and methodology, details of the pharmacological interventions, study duration, outcomes related to utilization (e.g. prescription trends, adherence), clinical effects (e.g. weight loss, metabolic control, clinical outcomes) and adverse events.

## UTILIZATION OF GLP‐1RA

Population‐based studies from the United States (US) and Europe have documented substantial increases in anti‐obesity medication use during the last decade,16, 22, 23, 24 accelerating with the introduction of semaglutide and tirzepatide for weight loss.16 In major weight loss RCTs, 65%--85% of participants adhered to the treatment with liraglutide, semaglutide, or tirzepatide, usually achieving target doses.19, 25, 26 However, GLP‐1RA treatments showed over twice the odds of discontinuation due to adverse events compared with placebo.27 Participants in RCTs are carefully selected and monitored in highly controlled environments, with close counselling by caregivers and no financial limitations on drug therapy, helping optimal adherence. In everyday clinical care, users are more likely to skip doses, take less than the prescribed amount, or not fill their prescriptions at all, due to factors like suboptimal insurance coverage, financial constraints, periodically limited drug accessibility, side effects and physician--patient barriers.28 As recently reviewed,28 lower education, lower income, older age and non‐White race are associated with 10%--50% lower odds of receiving GLP‐1RA versus other diabetes therapies in real‐world patients with T2DM. For T2D populations, studies suggested persistent drug use (i.e. no full discontinuation) in about 80% of users after 1 year in European settings,29, 30 but only in about 50% in Israel31 and the United States.32

Among people with obesity, there is evidence that GLP‐1RA discontinuation is even higher than in people with T2D.33, 34 A recent US study of 4066 obese people without T2D initiating any GLP‐1RA found only 32% therapy persistence at one year,35 while three other US studies suggested therapy persistence in 35%--50% at 1 year.33, 34, 36 In a Danish population‐based cohort study of 110 749 initiators of semaglutide for obesity, about 50% persisted for one year.37 Notably, only 10% followed the recommended semaglutide dose increases every four weeks, and only 12% reached the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg by their 5th prescription, with one in three users continuing with the low 1.0 mg dose for a prolonged time.37 Our own unpublished data

suggest that early discontinuation of semaglutide for weight loss is linked to low‐income areas, mental health issues, other comorbidities and younger age.38 Without insurance coverage, many initiators of semaglutide and tirzepatide cannot afford long‐term treatment,28 which is concerning given the higher obesity burden and treatment needs among those with lower socio‐economic status, mental illness, obesity‐related comorbidities and younger age.39, 40, 41

## EFFECTS OF GLP‐1RA FOR WEIGHT LOSS

### Clinical guidelines for GLP‐1RA therapies

Guidelines for the clinical management of people with obesity have generally lagged behind the rapid development of newer pharmacological therapies.42, 43 Existing guidelines have been reviewed recently by others, for example, Cornier,9 Yurista44 and Gaskin.45 While newer cardiology guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in 201946 and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 202147 cover weight loss in cardiovascular disease prevention, and the 2020 Canadian clinical practice guideline on obesity in adults48 offers good advice on assessment, prevention and treatment of obesity, these guidelines do not cover the most effective weight loss drugs currently in use, that is, semaglutide and tirzepatide.27 The newer American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines49 offer some guidance on the use of liraglutide and semaglutide.

### Clinical effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss in real‐world populations

Most studies evaluating the real‐world effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss are observational studies of the ‘before‐after' type, that is, comparing post‐treatment initiation body weight with pre‐treatment weight in people who all are exposed to the drug of interest. In total, we reviewed 24 studies50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 (Table 1), most of which were published recently, that is, in 2024.50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64

In general, many real‐world studies suggested smaller weight loss (in kg or %) than what has been observed in the RCTs (i.e. up to 6% with liraglutide, 14% with semaglutide and 18% with tirzepatide vs. placebo).74 Estimated weight loss was highly variable between studies; however, even within the same GLP‐1RA, this was related to differences in user characteristics such as the proportion with T2D and previous use or not of GLP‐1RA at baseline, differences in dosages of the drug, comprehensiveness of the weight management programme, follow‐up time and weight measure used (e.g. self‐reported or other measurements of body weight). The percentage weight reduction over typically 6--12 months of follow‐up thus ranged from 2.2% to 18.5% for liraglutide,52, 55 4.4% to 19.5% for semaglutide61, 65 and 4.8% to 21.2% for tirzepatide.50, 59 Importantly, the weight‐loss effectiveness of GLP‐1RA was similar to what has been observed in trials when focusing on the subgroup of adherent patients who consistently took their prescribed GLP‐1RA, for example, at 12 months follow‐up,50, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 61 whereas studies reporting results in an ‘as‐started' approach found considerably lower effectiveness.52, 59, 63, 66 Semaglutide and tirzepatide initiators appeared to achieve the greatest weight loss in real life, and weight loss effects were weaker for patients with T2D than for obese people without diabetes,52, 58, 65, 67 which was also observed in trials.18, 75 Only two studies of tirzepatide for T2D were identified,59, 60 and they reported lower weight loss results than in the trials. Both studies included many individuals switching to tirzepatide from other GLP‐1RAs, that is, individuals generally not included in the SURPASS and SURMOUNT‐1 trials, with those switching from semaglutide seemingly experiencing further weight loss on tirzepatide treatment.

### Comparative effectiveness studies of GLP‐1RA for weight loss

In general, there were few large, methodologically strong head‐to‐head comparative effectiveness studies of weight loss in obese users of different GLP‐1RA for weight loss (Table 2). Liraglutide has been compared with dulaglutide,76, 77, 78 showing no clear difference in weight loss. In patients receiving GLP‐1RA treatment for T2D or obesity, semaglutide use was more likely to lead to weight reduction of ≥10% compared with liraglutide use.52 In individuals without T2D, weight loss was 6.9% for semaglutide, 6.6% for liraglutide and 3.1% for dulaglutide.82 A newer large real‐world comparative cohort study from the US of more than 18 000 adults with overweight or obesity compared weight loss during treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide.79 The treatment was labelled for T2D, yet only 52% of individuals in the study were classified as having T2D. The achieved treatment doses were not reported. The study found a larger weight loss at 12 months for tirzepatide (-15.3%) versus semaglutide (-8.3%) in individuals who had not been excluded due to discontinuation or GLP‐1RA switching.79 Two recent studies based on the TriNetX database have compared users of tirzepatide with either users of semaglutide81 or other GLP‐1RAs (combined).80 Anson et al. followed individuals after six months of completed treatment with tirzepatide and semaglutide and found that tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss and decreased risk of developing T2D in individuals without pre‐existing diabetes compared with semaglutide at one‐year follow‐up.81 In patients with T2D, Chuang et al. found a greater effect on weight loss with tirzepatide than other GLP‐1RA combined; however, treatment duration was not reported.80 More well‐conducted real‐world studies in different cohorts and with comparable doses are required for concluding on real‐world comparative effectiveness.

### Adverse effects of GLP‐1RA in clinical practice

Although adverse effects with GLP‐1RA use are frequent21, 83 and may lead to use of low doses or total discontinuation, real‐world

evidence on when adverse effects lead to such outcomes in clinical practice is limited.[20,21] Further, the long-term safety of weight loss medications is not well understood, as weight loss RCTs have been relatively short (typical timespan 1-2 years) and too small to detect more rare adverse events with any certainty. As GLP-1RAs have been used to treat T2D for more than 15 years (although for a different population and usually in lower doses than for weight loss), real-world studies of T2D populations can offer some insight for weight-loss populations as well. Here, we summarise the available evidence on frequently reported and/or severe adverse events for GLP-1RA use,[83] focusing on newer large real-world population studies including GLP-1RA users with either obesity or T2D.

# 4.4.1 Gastrointestinal disturbances

GLP-1RA has numerous effects on the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system, including slowing gastric emptying, regulating appetite and nausea in the brainstem and hypothalamus, and affecting gut

motility and secretion. $^{84}$  Accordingly, in both RCTs and in adverse event reporting databases, mild to moderate gastrointestinal disturbances have been frequent, primarily nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal reflux, bloating, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation, $^{21,85}$  occurring in approximately  $80\%$  of GLP-1RA treated patients across all major weight loss RCTs. $^{17,19,25,74}$  In a meta-analysis of 76 RCTs in T2D, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide were all associated with significantly increased ORs of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. $^{27}$  The occurrence of such gastrointestinal side effects increases with the dose used. $^{86,87}$

Comparable real-world data are scarce, as mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms do not necessarily lead to healthcare contacts or registration in medical records or databases. In a community pharmacy-based survey of semaglutide users, six in 10 users reported having experienced side effects, most commonly nausea (35%) and constipation (29%),[88] suggesting a similar occurrence of these symptoms in clinical practice as in RCTs. Clinical practice experience implies that the symptoms are often dose dependent, observed during the dose escalation period, and tend to diminish over time with continued use.[79,84,89]

### Gastroparesis and intestinal obstruction

Severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including gastroparesis and intestinal obstruction/ileus, have been anecdotally reported with GLP‐1RA use, with a pharmacovigilance signal for intestinal obstruction seen in WHO's VigiBase.90 These signals have not generally been observed in RCTs74 and there is currently sparse real‐world evidence existing from large epidemiological studies. A recent real‐world study of people with obesity compared initiators of semaglutide and liraglutide to those initiating bupropion‐naltrexone and found markedly increased rates of bowel obstruction (hazard ratio [HR] 4.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02--17.40) and gastroparesis (3.67 [95% CI, 1.15--11.90]).91 However, this study has been criticized for methodological shortcomings.92 The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)93 has, however, made recommendations to hold GLP‐1RA medications on the day of surgical procedures for daily users and a week prior to an elective procedure for weekly users to reduce the risk of gastroparesis.84

### Gallbladder/biliary disease

A meta‐analysis from 2022 of 76 RCTs involving 103 371 patients starting GLP‐1RA drugs for either T2D or weight loss, compared with placebo or non‐GLP‐1RA drugs, found a modestly elevated RR of 1.37 (95% CI 1.23--1.52) for gallbladder or biliary disease.94 These risks seem dose dependent and there were higher risk estimates in RCTs for weight loss (RR 2.29; 95% CI 1.64--3.18) than for T2D (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14--1.43).95 A meta‐analysis of tirzepatide found an increased risk (albeit statistically imprecise) for gallbladder or biliary disease with this particular GLP‐1RA compared with the use of other GLP‐1RAs (RR 1.94; 95% CI 0.58--6.47).96 A real‐world study also found increased risks of biliary disease with any GLP‐1RA use compared with bupropion‐naltrexone (HR 1.5; 95% CI 0.9--2.5).91 A larger real‐world comparative cohort study of initiators of semaglutide and tirzepatide for overweight found no differences in risks of cholecystitis and cholelithiasis between these two drugs.79 Of note, the risk increase of developing gall stones is related to the magnitude of any weight loss in general, and, for example, bariatric surgery is associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent gallbladder or biliary disease.95

### Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer

A meta‐analysis of 11 cardiovascular outcome trials involving patients with T2D starting GLP‐1RA drugs found no materially elevated risk of acute pancreatitis (rate ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.78--1.41) or pancreatic cancer (rate ratio 1.14 [0.77--1.70]).97 Another meta‐analysis of 43 RCTs of different GLP‐1RAs for T2D found an OR of 1.24 (0.94--1.64) for pancreatitis and OR 1.28 (0.87--1.89) for pancreatic cancer.98 The absence of any strong association with pancreatitis for GLP‐1RAs has been corroborated by numerous large real‐world observational studies of patients with T2D already a decade ago.99, 100 Newer registry‐based T2D cohort studies have suggested a decreased risk of most obesity‐associated cancers in patients with T2D using GLP‐1RA, including decreased risks of pancreatic cancer among a US study (HR 0.41, 0.33--0.50)101 and Israel (HR 0.50, 0.15--1.71).102

In populations using GLP‐1 RAs in higher doses specifically for weight loss, less is currently known about pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risks.79, 91 A real‐world comparative cohort study found rates of pancreatitis of 4.6 (semaglutide) and 7.9 (liraglutide) per 1000 person‐years compared with a remarkably low rate of 1.0 in bupropion‐naltrexone initiators, yielding a high yet imprecise HR of 9.1 (95% CI 1.3--66.0).91 Another real‐world comparative cohort study of GLP‐1RA initiators for overweight found no difference between these semaglutide and tirzepatide (HR 1.04, 0.52--2.11).79 These real‐world pancreatitis rates of approximately 4 to 8 per 1000 person‐years with GLP‐1RA are several fold higher than in the major weight loss RCTs of liraglutide RCT.17, 18, 19, 26 Of note, meta‐analyses of RCTs in either T2D or weight loss have found no increased risk of pancreatitis.74, 103 However, in the RCTs, people were not eligible if they had a history of chronic or recent acute pancreatitis, and if they had any disorder (such as psychiatric illness or alcohol abuse) potentially compromising their trial compliance, which—together with more selective pancreatitis case adjudication in the trials—might explain the higher absolute pancreatitis risks in some real‐world studies. Although most clinical guidelines as well as EMA and FDA list pancreatitis as a possible side effect of GLP‐1RAs, most real‐world studies suggest no clear increased pancreatitis risk with GLP‐1RAs, thus corroborating findings from meta‐analyses of the RCTs.

### Thyroid cancer and other disorders

Treatment with liraglutide or exenatide has been associated with thyroid C‐cell proliferation and the formation of thyroid C‐cell tumours in rodents,104 although the relevance to humans is uncertain. Therefore, the FDA lists individual or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) as well as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2) as contraindications to the use of GLP‐1RA. Of note, the EMA has not included this in the European licensing of these drugs. A meta‐analysis of 45 RCTs including 94 063 participants treated with GLP‐1RAs for either glucose‐lowering or weight reduction found a weak association of GLP‐1RAs with any type of thyroid disorder overall (RR 1.28, 1.03--1.60), seemingly driven by liraglutide (1.37, 1.01--1.86) and dulaglutide (1.96, 1.11--3.45).105 The RR for any thyroid disorders was 1.32 (1.05--1.66) in T2D trials whereas it was close to unity (0.91, 0.33--2.51) in weight loss trials. The overall GLP‐1RA RR for thyroid cancer was 1.30 (0.86--1.97).105 A recent Scandinavian real‐world study106 found no increased risk of thyroid cancer among initiators of GLP‐1RA vs. dipeptidyl‐peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Another multinational real‐world study of GLP‐1RA initiators corroborated this with a pooled weighted HR 0.81 (CI 0.59--1.12).107 Thus, most available evidence, both from trials and real‐world settings,

suggests that any association between GLP‐1RAs and thyroid cancer is either weak or non‐existent.

### Depression and suicidality

Obesity and T2D per se are associated with depression,108 with GLP‐1RA showing protective effects against neuroinflammation in animal models that may in theory reduce depression risk.109 Substantial weight loss can improve mental wellbeing but may also demask unresolved psychological issues.110 Both weight loss drugs and bariatric surgery have been linked to a potentially increased risk of thoughts of self‐harm and suicide,111 with the EMA investigating numerous spontaneous reports in 2023.112 A recent systematic review of real‐world studies investigating the risk of depression in people with T2D using GLP‐1RAs found no clear evidence of such an association, with most relative risk estimates close to 1.0.109 Two newer large active‐comparator new‐user studies corroborated the absence of association with suicidal ideation and behaviours, suicide death, or self‐harm, with adjusted HRs for GLP‐1RA versus SGLT2i close to unity.112, 113

### Eye disease

The SUSTAIN‐6 trial of semaglutide for T2D suggested a potential link of this GLP‐1RA with worsening diabetic retinopathy,114 which was not observed in, for example, the liraglutide or dulaglutide trials.115 Later subgroup and mediation analyses suggested that the majority of the effect might be attributed to a large and rapid glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction, a recognized risk factor for early worsening of diabetic retinopathy,116 especially among patients with high HbA1c and baseline signs of retinopathy.117 Several large real‐world studies have examined the association between GLP‐1RA and retinopathy, with apparently conflicting results in three recent large cohort studies,115, 118, 119 leaving the question unsettled. Recent anecdotal evidence also suggests that semaglutide may be associated with an increased risk of non‐arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare but important cause of blindness in adults.120 This was suggested in a study of selected patients evaluated by neuro‐ophthalmologists at one academic institution (with a remarkably high occurrence of NAION overall),120 and just recently corroborated in two large studies from Scandinavia finding a more than doubled risk of NAION with GLP‐1RA use in T2D.121, 122 More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between GLP‐1RAs and eye diseases.

## FUTURE REAL‐WORLD RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

As evident above, there are numerous unmet research needs within the real‐world space for use of GLP‐1RA for weight loss. Here, we summarise 10 selected areas that we consider of particular importance for further studies.

### Overall drug utilization

With the rapid shift in treatment patterns, there is a need for continuously updated population‐based drug utilization data, including key aspects such as costs and treatment persistence. The mapping of real‐world users' characteristics to those of patients included in the phase III trials will help identify shifts in patient population and potentially explain different real‐world effects. Finally, the use of doses lower than those tested in the trials28, 37 should be monitored.

### Responders

While the persistence to the use of GLP‐1RAs does not seem worse compared with many other drugs, a substantial proportion cease treatment early on.29, 30, 31, 35 There is a need to understand what specific patient characteristics or subgroups drive such early discontinuation and to what extent (and for which patients) it is caused by lack of tolerability or lack of effect.

### Real‐world effects

While the GLP‐1RA is generally accepted to be highly efficacious in selected trial settings, there are multiple reasons why effect sizes could be expected in the real‐world setting as discussed above, including the use of lower doses and differences in patient characteristics. Thus, the real‐world weight‐lowering effect and the cardiovascular and renal benefits documented in clinical trials123, 124, 125 should be studied not only for the use of the drugs as intended in the trials and for similar patients, but also for effects in groups not included in the trials and with the use of lower doses.

### Comparative effects

Our review showed that most real‐world studies have studied individual GLP‐1RAs (Table 1), and only a few have performed comparative effectiveness or safety assessments (Table 2). Direct comparisons will be essential as they not only provide information of higher clinical relevance but also support more solid evidence, as the use of active comparators will likely reduce confounding in the assessment of both the efficacy and safety of these drugs.

### Other effects

Outside the main effects on weight and cardiovascular and kidney risks, there is a need to study additional clinical effects of GLP‐1RA

use for weight management. This includes a continuum of secondary effects ranging from those that can be tied directly to the drugs' weight‐lowering properties, such as reduction in the use of analgesics for arthritis or in the use of antifungals for infections, over less specific effects, such as changes in healthcare utilisation or use of psychotropics, to possibly true pleiotropic effects, for example, in the prevention of cancer or dementia.

### Cost‐effectiveness

Considering the substantial cost of using GLP‐1RA for weight management, there is a need to investigate the cost‐effectiveness of these drugs regarding endpoints such as cardiovascular events and total mortality. Current, although sparse, real‐world evidence suggests very high costs per prevented event in the total population,126 pointing to a specific need to map cost‐effectiveness across various patient subgroups.

### Effects of stopping

With many patients having achieved their desired weight loss using GLP‐1RAs, there is an urgent need to study the effects of stopping treatment. Current evidence from trials suggests that weight is regained rapidly for patients who discontinue GLP‐1RA treatment,127, 128, 129 and worryingly, a substantial part of this regain seems to be fat mass.130 However, the clinical relevance of this finding, with patients blinded to whether they received continued treatment or placebo, is very limited, as it mimics neither the situation nor the way in which treatment is stopped in clinical practice. Thus, real‐world studies on the effects of stopping GLP‐1RA treatment after having achieved a significant weight loss, as well as those of alternatives such as dose reduction or spacing, are needed.131

### Adverse events in obesity

As our review shows (Table 3), our knowledge on adverse events for the GLP‐1RAs is largely based on the study of these drugs in the management of diabetes. There are several reasons why data on adverse events might not translate between these populations. For one, the users of GLP‐1RAs for weight management are roughly 20--25 years younger on average than those using the same drugs for the management of diabetes. Even under the strong assumption that the relative risk increases translate between these populations, the much lower baseline risk of most diseases among younger individuals will make the absolute magnitude of such risks markedly different. Second, some adverse effects might be directly or indirectly linked to the indication of diabetes and hyperglycaemia. This is obvious for diabetic retinopathy, and also hypothesized for the use of GLP‐1RA and risk of NAION, making it uncertain whether the same effect can be expected with the use of the drugs for weight management. As such, there is a need to study the occurrence of adverse effects specifically among users of GLP‐1RA for weight management and in particular the absolute risk of these effects.

### Methodological quality

With the growing body of literature on the real‐world use and effects of GLP‐1RA, there is an increasing need to not only summarise this literature but also to evaluate and strengthen its methodological quality. Areas of particular focus are how to avoid selection bias, which is a frequent concern in studies that only include ‘drug survivors',53, 55, 58, 60, 61, 62, 65, 67, 70, 71 that is, those retaining treatment over a prolonged period, or those restricting their analyses to high‐dose users.57

### Data availability

The many real‐world data sources available have their individual strengths and limitations. The identification of which data sources can be used to answer what research questions is central. For example, in most data sources, the general use of drugs other than GLP‐1RA for obesity is limited, rendering the use of active comparators outside this drug class in the study of GLP‐1RA effects difficult. However, some settings do have such use, for example, in Norway with a considerable use of naloxone/bupropion.24 Another key problem is that many real‐world data sources hold limited or no information on anthropometric measures including body weight or height, which precludes the direct assessment of real‐world efficacy on weight or BMI. Such information is, however, available in data sources such as the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database in the United Kingdom, and in population surveys that can be linked with other health registries, in Scandinavia for example the Trøndelag Health Study,136 the Danish Health and Morbidity surveys,137 and the Better Health in Late Life cohort.138 Further, several other factors will influence weight loss (i.e. physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol intake, health literacy) and data on these parameters is rarely available in real‐world studies, which may lead to uncontrolled confounding.

## CONCLUSIONS

Real‐world evidence supports the effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss, but the observed weight reduction in therapy initiators overall tends to be lower than in randomised controlled trials, likely due to lower adherence, persistence and the use of reduced doses in clinical practice. Semaglutide and tirzepatide starters appear to achieve the greatest weight loss, with emerging data suggesting that real‐world outcomes may approach those seen in trials among highly adherent patients. Adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances, frequently lead to discontinuation, but otherwise, real‐world data provide little evidence for severe adverse effects.

obesity population and, in particular, long-term safety outcomes remain insufficiently studied. Future research should focus on comparative effectiveness, long-term clinical impacts, treatment discontinuation effects and cost-effectiveness to optimise the real-world application of these therapies. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for refining clinical guidelines, ensuring equitable access and guiding future pharmacological strategies for obesity management.

Objectives: In Korea, cardio-cerebrovascular disease (CCVD) is recognized as an occupational disease when sufficient evidence of a work-related burden exists. In 2021, approximately 26.8% of the payments from occupational disease insurance under the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act were allocated to CCVDs. However, due to the specific nature of insurance policies for farmers, CCVD is not acknowledged as an occupational disease in their case.

Methods: We reviewed studies on the differences in the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of CCVDs between farmers and the general population or other occupations and described the exposure of farmers to risk factors for CCVDs.

Results: Several studies showed that farming is a high-risk occupation for CCVDs, with the following risk factors: long working hours, night work, lack of holidays, and strenuous physical labor; physical factors (noise, cold, heat, humidity, and vibration); exposure to hazardous gases (diesel exhaust, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, nitrogen oxides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), pesticides, and dust (particulate matter, silica, and organic dust); exposure to a hypoxic environment; and job-related stress. Social isolation and lack of accessible medical facilities also function as additional risk factors by preventing farmers from receiving early interventions.

Conclusions: Farmers are exposed to various risk factors for CCVDs and are an occupation at risk for CCVDs. More studies are needed in the future to elucidate this relationship. This study lays the groundwork for future research to develop guidelines for approving CCVDs as occupational diseases among farmers.

# INTRODUCTION

Industrialization has rapidly progressed in Korea, leading to long working hours, night shift work, and various work-related burdens. Thus, cardio-cerebrovascular disease (CCVD) is recognized as an occupational disease in Korea when a sufficient work-related burden is confirmed [1]. In Korea, most workers (excluding those in occupations protected by other insurance,

such as civil servants, military personnel, and teachers) are covered for various diseases, including CCVDs, under the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act (IACIA). The compensation paid to workers for occupational CCVDs has been increasing annually; in 2021, it reached 581.15 billion Korean won [2]. However, agriculture, forestry, and fishing are exempt from this law under certain conditions. These sectors are not protected if the activity involves fewer than 5 people or is classified as a family employment activity. Therefore, the agricultural sector is in a blind spot, outside the scope of protection of the social security system known as industrial accident insurance. Traditionally, small-scale farmers and their families have been considered business owners or self-employed rather than workers. As a result, farmers who are both business owners and workers have faced high insurance premiums to obtain IACIA coverage. It is estimated that only about 2-3% of the farm population is covered by the IACIA [3]. Farmers with optional rather than mandatory insurance face several challenges in voluntarily joining the IACIA due to poor economic conditions. Farmer Safety Insurance (FSI) was implemented in 1996 to address these issues through government support. However, FSI is optional and not mandatory, resulting in a relatively low subscription rate (64.8% in 2019), and it primarily covers accidents rather than diseases such as CCVDs. Additionally, there are challenges such as a narrow scope of coverage and the fact that FSI is managed by private financial institutions rather than the government. Despite the establishment of the FSI system, many farmers hesitate to join due to poor economic conditions [4,5]. This scoping review aimed to describe and summarize the scientific literature on the risk factors for CCVDs in farmers. Additionally, we reviewed studies

that describe the differences in the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of CCVDs among farmers compared to the general population or other occupations. Through this review, we intend to provide evidence to support the expansion of insurance coverage for CCVDs in farmers.

# METHODS

## Steps for Conducting a Scoping Review

A scoping review is a type of review that rapidly identifies the main concepts, resources, and evidence within a specific field of study. This study was conducted using the scoping review methodology [6,7].

## Identifying the Research Question and Purposes

In Korea, the standards for occupational compensation for CCVDs among farmers are inadequate. Currently, most occupational CCVDs in this group are not covered by insurance. As an initial step toward establishing compensation standards for CCVDs in farmers, we plan to conduct a scoping review addressing the following questions: (1) What is the status of approval of CCVDs as occupational diseases among farmers in Korea? (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1). (2) Is the incidence of CCVD among farmers higher than that in the general population? (Table 2). (3) What are the occupational risk factors for CCVD? (Table 3). (4) Which of these risk factors can farmers be exposed to? (Supplemental Material 1).

## Identifying a Team of Experts and Consulting

A scoping review was conducted by a team comprising 5 researchers and 6 experts, totaling eleven members. The team

Two researchers investigated the risk factors, incidence, prevalence, and mortality of CCVDs in farmers based on published textbooks and reports. We also received and analyzed related research reports from researchers affiliated with the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences [8].

## Charting, Collating, Summarizing, and Reporting the Results

We presented 4 tables corresponding to the questions of this study, as well as 2 figures showing that although the number and amount of compensation for occupational CCVDs is increasing in Korea, farmers are being excluded. Through this review, we intend to provide evidence for expanding the scope of insurance coverage for CCVDs in farmers.

## Ethics Statement

This study was a scoping review of published literature and did not involve direct human subjects research. As such, it did not require approval from an institutional review board. All data analyzed were from previously published studies that

had already undergone ethical review and approval as part of their original publication process. No additional ethical considerations were required for the conduct of this secondary analysis of publicly available data.

## RESULTS

Table 1 displays the number of farmers affiliated with IACIA, which includes agricultural corporations or businesses with 5 or more employees, alongside the number of CCVDs recognized as work-related diseases. In 2021, 78 999 farmers from 20 302 agricultural businesses enrolled in IACIA. Of these, 6 farmers were officially recognized as having occupational CCVDs, and 2 of them died [9]. The IACIA subscription rate of farmers remains unchanged (Table 1); however, FSI, a type of private insurance, does not classify CCVDs as an occupational disease within its terms and conditions. Consequently, the cases of insurance coverage for farmers' CCVDs represent only a minor fraction of the total compensations at IACIA, and finding such compensation cases at FSI was challenging.

Although inconsistent, several studies analyzing the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rate of CCVDs among farmers have indicated high rates in this demographic. Specifically, among females, the age-standardized prevalence rate of circulatory system diseases (International Classification of Diseases-10th revision: I00-I99) was higher in farmers (24 498.8 per 100 000) compared to non-farmers (23 957.1 per 100 000) across all years, according to data from Korea's National Health Insurance (KNHI). The KNHI also offers insurance premium reductions for farmers and fishermen, which helps distinguish between farmers and non-farmers [10]. In another study using the KNHI database, the age-adjusted incidence per 1000 person-years was significantly higher in farmers for both myocardial infarction (0.766 vs. 0.585) and stroke (0.559 vs. 0.321) [11]. In a population census study in Spain, the excess mortality rate of cardiovascular disease among farmers was 22.3% higher [12]. The research results from several countries are also included in Table 2 [10-17].

Various chemicals, heavy metals, dust, radiation, abnormal temperatures, vibration, noise, physical labor, mental stress, long working hours, and night shift work are recognized as occupational risk factors for CCVDs (Supplemental Material 1). A literature review was conducted on the exposure levels of farmers to these occupational risk factors for CCVDs, summarizing the high exposure level values. The findings from previous studies indicate that farming is a high-risk occupation for CCVDs. The associated risk factors include stress from long working hours, night shifts, limited holidays, and intense physical labor; physical factors such as noise, cold, high temperatures, humidity, and vibration; exposure to hazardous gases including diesel exhaust, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, nitrogen oxides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; pesticides; and dusts like particulate matter, silica, and organic dust. Additionally, farmers face exposure to hypoxic environments and job-related stress (Table 3) [18-32]. Focusing on temperature-related risk factors, an increase of 1°C in temperature correlates with a 2.1% increase in cardiovascular diseases-related mortality. During high-intensity heatwaves, this mortality risk can surge by 18.9%. The pooled relative risks for extreme cold (first percentile of temperature) and cold (10th percentile of temperature) over lags of 0-14 days are 1.39 and 1.11, respectively, compared to the 25th percentile. Similarly, the relative risks of stroke mortality are 1.06 for extremely hot temperatures and 1.14 for hot temperatures, compared to the 75th percentile of temperature [31,32]. This review confirms that farmers are potentially exposed to a high level of various CCVD risk factors.

## DISCUSSION

In this study, we reviewed research on the differences in incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of CCVDs among farmers compared to the general population and other occupations. We also explored the exposure of farmers to various CCVD risk factors. The findings from multiple studies indicate that farming is a high-risk occupation for CCVDs. The associated risk factors include stress due to long working hours, night shifts, limited holidays, and intense physical labor; physical factors such as noise, extreme temperatures, humidity, and vibration; exposure to hazardous gases including diesel exhaust, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, nitrogen oxides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; and contact with pesticides and dusts like particulate matter, silica, and organic dust. Additionally, exposure to hypoxic environments and job-related stress are significant concerns. Social isolation and the lack of accessible medical facilities hinder early intervention for farmers, further elevating their risk.

Agriculture, construction, and mining rank among the top 3 most hazardous occupations. According to the International Labor Organization, approximately 170 000 agricultural work

ers globally lose their lives each year due to workplace accidents. The rate of fatal accidents in agriculture is twice that of other industries, with an additional 40 000 agricultural workers dying annually from pesticide exposure. Sustainable agriculture practices are essential not only for food security but also for human health and environmental well-being [33,34]. To support societal development and ensure its survival, it is imperative to establish a safe working environment for farmers.

In the 1970s, the Korea was predominantly an agricultural nation, with 14.422 million people, or 44.7% of the total population, engaged in agriculture. By 2021, this number had decreased to 2.215 million, representing just 4.3% of the population [35]. The country's economic development plan promoted industrialization, leading to a migration from rural areas to urban centers. This shift not only delayed agricultural development due to technical and financial limitations but also broadened the scope of compensation for injuries and diseases among general workers through the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the IACIA (Figures 1 and 2). However, the development of protective systems for farmers has lagged behind. For instance, while general workers can receive approval for CCVDs as an occupational disease, farmers face significant challenges in obtaining similar recognition.

Korea is experiencing a demographic shift, with a rapidly increasing proportion of its population aged 65 years and older, presenting challenges for the agricultural sector. In 2000, over 7% of the population in Korea was elderly, a figure that rose to over 14% by 2017. As of July 2023, this proportion has reached 18.5% and is expected to exceed 20% by 2025, marking the transition to a post-aged society [36]. Rural areas are aging more rapidly than urban ones [37], and the farming population is not only shrinking but also aging, significantly heightening the risk of CCVDs. In Korea, the majority of farmers operate small family units comprising fewer than 5 people, serving both as laborers and business owners [3]. Thus, the incidence of CCVDs among these farm members directly results in a decline in agricultural productivity, effectively leading to the loss of an agricultural business. This situation contributes to long-term income disparities between farmers and non-farmers. The aging farmer community thus represents a major socioeconomic burden on farms and will play a crucial role in determining the future of agriculture in Korea. To address this, comprehensive primary, secondary, and tertiary preventive measures for CCVDs among farmers are essential.

Advances in agricultural technology can help address these challenges by enhancing productivity and efficiency through modern technologies and automation, such as artificial intelligence and robots. The adoption of precision agriculture, smart farm technologies, and sustainable farming practices represents key strategies for modernizing agriculture. Each year, more than 15 000 farmers and their families return to farming in Korea, with the number reaching 16 906 in 2022 and peaking at 20 559 in 2016 [38]. Given the global economic challenges and the weaponization of food, the agricultural output of each country has become crucial to societal well-being. Implementing smart farm technologies can lead to more efficient resource use and increased productivity, thus boosting agricultural competitiveness. Furthermore, the development of innovative agricultural technologies is vital for tackling the issues posed by climate change and population growth. In this era of agricultural innovation, a national-level social safety net is necessary to keep the population engaged in agriculture, necessitating more effective insurance for farmers.

This study has several limitations. Primarily, it is a scoping review rather than a systematic review, serving to organize and catalog related research without offering conclusive evidence on whether farmers have a higher or lower risk of CCVDs than the general population. As a result, this study only suggests potential associations and carries a risk of publication bias by potentially excluding studies that report low-risk or non-significant findings. In Korea, criteria for determining the work-relatedness of workers' CCVDs have been established and are continuously refined by the IACIA [1]. However, these standards are not directly applicable to self-employed farmers. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider their applicability when evaluating the work-relatedness of CCVDs in farmers.

This study is significant as it explores the association between CCVDs and farming, a topic that has previously received limited attention. Through our research, we have identified multiple studies indicating that farmers are exposed to various risk factors for CCVD, categorizing them as an occupation at risk. Future studies should aim to further elucidate this relationship through systematic reviews of specific diseases and risk factors, the development of objective methods for evaluating farmers' exposure to these risk factors, or the analysis of big data from health insurance records. Looking ahead, based on the findings of this study and the broader social consensus, several issues warrant consideration: (1) Should it become mandatory for farmers to join IACIA? (2) Should CCVDs be added to the list of diseases covered by FSI? (3) What should

the approval process look like if CCVDs are included in the FSI disease list? Although the process of professional investigation and committee rulings such as IACIA is highly valid, it can be time-consuming and socioeconomically expensive. Automatic approval under certain conditions would enable a quicker process and reduce the socioeconomic costs associated with investigations and decisions. However, it may not account for the unique aspects of each case, and if the standards are set too high or too low, accurate judgments may be compromised.

## CONCLUSION

Workers' rights and social safety nets have rapidly developed in Korea. However, the development of systems to protect farmers has lagged, positioning them within the vulnerable occupation group. The modernization of agriculture is essential for national development, necessitating the establishment of systems to safeguard farmers. This study lays the groundwork for future research on guidelines for occupational disease approval for CCVDs among farmers.

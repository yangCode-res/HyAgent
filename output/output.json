                "mechanism_explanation": "The provided context describes a comprehensive mechanistic cascade: 1) **Hemodynamic Initiation**: Low/oscillatory wall shear stress (WSS) at bifurcations induces endothelial dysfunction, characterized by a cobblestone EC morphology and a pro-inflammatory, pro-adhesive state. 2) **Lipid Retention and Modification**: Dysfunctional endothelium allows LDL infiltration and subsequent oxidation (oxLDL) in the intima. 3) **Inflammatory Amplification**: oxLDL uptake via receptors like CD36 in macrophages and VSMCs leads to intracellular cholesterol crystal formation, lysosomal destabilization, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This results in caspase-1 activation and the secretion of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18). 4) **Cellular Transformation and Plaque Development**: Inflammatory signals and growth factors (e.g., PDGF, IL-1) drive VSMC migration from the media to the intima, phenotypic switching to a synthetic state, proliferation, and extracellular matrix production, contributing to both foam cell formation and fibrous cap development. This integrated path from disturbed flow to chronic inflammation and vascular remodeling encapsulates the core pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.",

Concurrently, EAT-derived factors may influence endothelial transcytosis, a process critical for lipoprotein entry into the vessel wall and regulated by structures like caveolae and caveolin-1.

                "mechanism_explanation": "The provided context describes a comprehensive pathophysiological sequence: 1) Low/oscillatory WSS at arterial bifurcations causes endothelial cobblestone morphology and dysfunction, disrupting homeostasis. 2) Dysfunctional endothelium allows LDL infiltration and oxidation in the intima. 3) oxLDL is taken up by macrophages (via CD36/TLR4/6) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs via SR-A, CD36, LOX-1), forming foam cells. 4) Intracellular cholesterol crystals from oxLDL uptake activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, leading to caspase-1 activation and production of IL-1β/IL-18. 5) Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, PDGF) from macrophages and foam cells promote VSMC migration from media to intima, phenotypic switching to synthetic state, proliferation, and extracellular matrix production, forming the fibrous cap over the necrotic core. 6) The review also mentions modulation by microRNAs, lncRNAs, microbiota, and sex as crucial risk factors, suggesting these elements regulate various steps in this cascade.",

(4) Intracellular cholesterol crystals from oxLDL uptake activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to caspase-1 activation and production of IL-1β/IL-18, sustaining inflammation. (5) Inflammatory signals (e.g., IL-1, PDGF) promote VSMC migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix production, forming the fibrous cap. (6) VSMC-derived foam cells significantly contribute to plaque volume, and their reduced cholesterol efflux (low ABCA1) exacerbates lipid accumulation.

Stress may disrupt efferocytic pathways (e.g., MERTK signaling) or promote pro-apoptotic signaling.

The context provides mechanisms for calcification: VSMC-derived exosomes mediate calcification (217), and matrix vesicles in the cap may contribute to rupture (215).

High stress may promote the VSMC switch to an osteogenic phenotype and the release of calcifying exosomes (217), leading to spotty calcifications that alter local stress fields and potentially weaken the fibrous cap (214, 215), affecting the overall 'atherosclerotic plaque' entity.",

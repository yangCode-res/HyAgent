        "contexts": "Phenotypic chemical suppressor screens, where cell death induced by one molecule is blocked by the action of a second molecule, have helped dissect the ferroptosis mechanism and identify specific inhibitors of this process. From a library of over 2,000 annotated bioactive compounds, antioxidants (e.g. α-tocopherol, β-carotene, butylated hydroxytoluene) and iron chelators (e.g. deferoxamine) were found to block cell death induced by erastin (Yagoda et al. 2007). This study first illuminated the fundamental oxidative, iron-dependent nature of this process. Further chemical suppressor screening\n\nusing large unannotated compound libraries tested in erastin-treated cancer cells or inducible Gpx4^{-/-} mouse embryonic fibroblasts pinpointed the potent ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 (Dixon et al. 2012; Friedmann Angeli et al. 2014). These two compounds have been essential for a range of mechanistic and animal model studies (Dixon et al. 2012; Fang et al. 2019; Friedmann Angeli et al. 2014; Li et al. 2017; Linkermann et al. 2014).\n\n### Chemoproteomics.\n\nIdentifying the target(s) of small molecules isolated in phenotypic screens is an important and often arduous task. A classic approach involves the use of affinity analogs, purification, and protein identification using mass spectrometry. An important success using this approach was the identification of GPX4 as a direct target of RSL3 (Yang et al. 2014). Two features of RSL3 aided the success of the chemoproteomic approach here. First, RSL3 contains a chloroacetamide ‘warhead' that reacts covalently with GPX4. Second, only the 1S,3R diastereomer of RSL3 is active, making it possible to identify GPX4 as a protein uniquely bound to active (1S,3R) but not inactive (1R,3R) analogs. A similar chemoproteomic strategy has recently been successfully deployed to identify the small antioxidant protein thioredoxin (TXN) as a covalent target of the ferroptosis-inducing compound ferroptocide (Llabani et al. 2019). Mutagenesis studies indicate that ferroptocide binds to the active site cysteine residues of thioredoxin as well as to an adjacent cysteine residue. How thioredoxin inhibition triggers ferroptosis is not clear but could involve enhanced lipid peroxidation due to disruption of the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase cycle (Bjornstedt et al. 1995).\n\nWhile powerful in principle, affinity chemoproteomics has not always yielded straightforward answers. These methods, used together with both lethal and non-lethal analogs of erastin, identified mitochondrial voltage anion channel (VDAC) 2 and 3 as targets of this molecule (Yagoda et al. 2007). Functionally, erastin reduces the permeability of VDAC1 and VDAC2 when these proteins are expressed in yeast (Yagoda et al. 2007), and can alter VDAC function, stability, and interaction with other proteins in mammalian cells (Maldonado et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2020). However, the ability of erastin to induce ferroptosis is best explained by inhibition of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system x_{c}^{-}, leading to depletion of glutathione and other metabolites (Dixon et al. 2014) (and see below). This link between erastin and system x_{c}^{-} was not discovered using unbiased methods, but rather using a small scale phenotypic similarity profiling analysis, driven by the hypothesis that erastin triggered oxidative cell death (Dixon et al. 2012). Chemoproteomic results are therefore not a panacea, perhaps especially when dealing with compounds that engage targets non-covalently.\n\n### Chemical genetic screens.\n\nLethal small molecules can be combined with genetic screening to identify genes that normally promote or suppress cell death. These methods have been applied successfully to the study of several nonapoptotic cell death pathways, including ferroptosis. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), insertional mutagenesis in human haploid cells, and CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies have all been used in ferroptosis loss of\n\nfunction suppressor screens (Table 2). Perhaps as could be anticipated from previous chemical suppressor screens, these genetic screens have identified genes that govern lipid metabolism (e.g. ACSL4, LPCAT3), iron homeostasis (e.g. IREB2, ATM), and redox metabolism (CARS, KEAP1) (Chen et al. 2019; Dixon et al. 2012; Dixon et al. 2015; Doll et al. 2017a; Hayano et al. 2015; Zou et al. 2019). Disruption of these genes limits ferroptosis by reducing the levels of oxidizable membrane lipids, lowering intracellular free iron, or increasing the antioxidant capacity of the cell.\nThe cytokine TNFα is a potent trigger for apoptosis, but over two decades ago it was observed that cells treated with the pro-apoptotic stimulus TNFα and a small molecule caspase inhibitor like zVAD-fmk still succumbed to cell death and, in fact, appeared to do so more readily (Vercammen et al. 1998). The thioxo-imidazolidinone necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) was identified from a small molecule screen as a specific inhibitor of cell death under these conditions (Degterev et al. 2005) (see Table 1, selected small molecule structures). This inhibitor blocked receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) function, implying that cell death was regulated by phosphorylation (Degterev et al. 2008). Nec-1 analogs also suppressed pathological cell death in the nervous system, demonstrating the in vivo relevance of this process (Degterev et al. 2005). This form of cell death was rechristened necroptosis, a portmanteau of necrosis and apoptosis, highlighting that it was a regulated form of cell death distinct from apoptosis. Small molecule screening subsequently helped identify additional important regulators of this process, including mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), which is inhibited by the small molecule necrosulfonamide (Sun et al. 2012). Thus, the necroptosis field provided a conceptual road map for how new nonapoptotic cell death pathways could be discovered using chemical biology approaches. The full power of chemical biology-driven approaches to pinpoint and characterize new forms of nonapoptotic cell death is, however, perhaps best demonstrated by the example of ferroptosis.\n\nFerroptosis is one of several new nonapoptotic cell death processes to be recognized in the past two decades (Conrad and Pratt, 2019; Galluzzi et al. 2018). This process can be triggered by inactivation of the system x_{c}^{-} cystine/glutamate antiporter (leading to depletion of intracellular glutathione), direct inhibition of the glutathione-dependent lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4, and possibly other mechanisms. GPX4 inhibition ultimately leads to the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides which eventually kill the cell (Cao and Dixon, 2016; Stockwell et al. 2017). While ferroptosis was named in 2012, similar processes have been observed for decades in various contexts where glutathione metabolism is disrupted (Hirschhorn and Stockwell, 2018; Lewerenz et al. 2018). What crucially\n\nenabled ferroptosis to be recognized as a distinct mode of nonapoptotic cell death was the discovery and characterization of potent and specific small molecule inducers and inhibitors of this process (Table 1). These highly portable tools have been leveraged to investigate ferroptosis using a host of chemical biology approaches in a wide array of models.\n\nBelow, we describe how different chemical biology approaches enabled ferroptosis to be identified and studied (summarized in Figure 2). We provide examples of how early discoveries catalyzed a virtuous cycle of innovation leading to new methods and probes to study ferroptosis. This has not occurred without some bumps along the way, and we therefore point out some limitations of current methods. We conclude by considering how chemical biology approaches could help elucidate additional nonapoptotic cell death mechanisms.\n\n## Chemical Biology and Ferroptosis\n\n### Phenotypic small molecule screening.\n\nSmall molecule phenotypic screening is a powerful means to discover compounds with novel mechanisms of action (Wagner and Schreiber, 2016). Here, libraries of small molecules are searched in an unbiased manner for those that can produce a given phenotype of interest. Advantageously, such screens have the potential to unveil new or unexpected biochemical mechanisms that modulate this cellular phenotype.\n\nErastin and 1S,3R-RSL3 (hereafter RSL3) are prototypic inducers of ferroptosis, originally discovered in large-scale (~25--50,000 compounds) phenotypic screens designed to identify compounds that were selectively lethal to engineered tumor cells expressing oncogenic mutant HRAS^{V12} (Dolma et al. 2003; Yang and Stockwell, 2008). Serendipitously, the use of a generic metabolism-based cell viability readout made these screens agnostic to the nature of the cell death process that was activated by a given lethal small molecule. While not apparent initially, detailed characterization of the erastin and RSL3 mechanisms of action eventually led to the discovery that these compounds triggered ferroptosis (Dixon et al. 2012). Had the original phenotypic screens been designed to report specifically on the induction of apoptosis, these ferroptosis-inducing small molecules would likely have gone undiscovered. Subsequently, fourteen additional lethal molecules, including ML162 and ML210, were identified from over a million compounds tested for HRAS^{V12}-selective lethality and shown to trigger ferroptosis (Weiwer et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014). Other phenotypic screens, looking for cell death without caspase activation, or enhanced cell death following glutathione depletion, identified additional inducers of ferroptosis, including sorafenib and FIN56 (Dixon et al. 2014; Lachaier et al. 2014; Shimada et al. 2016b).\n",

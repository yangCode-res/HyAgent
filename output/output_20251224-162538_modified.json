The user query states that standard-dose rifampin has limited CNS penetration, which is a critical problem in TBM. Therefore, a mechanistic hypothesis is that by modifying the regimen (e.g., increasing rifampicin dose, using alternative formulations, or adding adjuvants) to specifically boost the EBA component within the CNS, we can overcome the penetration limitation and improve bacterial clearance in the meninges.",

However, both sputum smear and culture at Month 2 have been demonstrated to have low sensitivity and modest specificity for predicting treatment failure or relapse.^{35} If it is true that low drug serum concentrations contribute to therapeutic failure, therapeutic drug monitoring with dose adjustment, or perhaps even an overhaul of our current dosing strategy might offer a practical way to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the costs associated with extended treatment.^{18,19,36--38}\n\nThe present systematic review summarises the available evidence on the association between first-line TB drug concentrations in adult patients with DS-TB and treatment outcome. Meta-analysis was conducted to compare WHO-defined treatment outcomes between patients with therapeutic and low first-line drug serum concentrations.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Search strategy and selection criteria\n\nStudies were identified in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.^{39} Systematic searches of Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted, from inception to 31 March 2018, for publications in which pharmacokinetic data of first-line TB drugs and treatment outcomes were reported. The search strategy included the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms in titles and abstracts: (‘tuberculosis' OR ‘rifampicin' OR ‘rifampin' OR ‘isoniazid' OR ‘pyrazinamide' OR ‘ethambutol' OR ‘antimycobacterial' OR ‘antituberculosis' OR ‘antitubercular agents') AND (‘drug monitoring' OR ‘concentration' OR ‘pharmacokinetic' OR ‘outcome'). Publications were limited to human studies in the English language. A manual search of all pertinent articles from the reference list of identified articles was conducted to identify additional articles not found by the electronic search.\n",

Optimizing treatment requires a comprehensive approach that integrates therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), dose adjustment based on CNS-specific PK/PD targets (such as AUC:MIC ratio in cerebrospinal fluid), and potentially novel dosing regimens or adjunctive therapies to enhance CNS penetration and bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the meninges.",

                "mechanism_explanation": "The hypothesis addresses the query's concern about limited CNS rifampin penetration by targeting CSF-specific PK/PD thresholds. Standard-dose rifampin achieves CSF:serum ratios of only ~0.3, resulting in subtherapeutic CSF concentrations (typically <1 mg/L) against M. tuberculosis (MIC ~0.06-0.5 mg/L). Interpatient variability in rifampin AUC exceeds 50%, contributing to treatment heterogeneity. While immunopathology contributes to TBM outcomes, we assume bacterial killing in CSF remains a primary driver of clinical improvement. The target CSF AUC0-24/MIC >100 is based on preclinical data suggesting this threshold maximizes bactericidal activity in CNS compartments. This approach differs from standard PK/PD optimization by focusing on compartment-specific targets rather than plasma targets.",

Primary endpoints: (1) Time to CSF sterilization (culture negativity), (2) CSF AUC0-24/MIC ratio achievement, (3) Safety (grade 3+ hepatotoxicity). Protocol requires IRB approval with specific consent procedures for encephalopathic patients (surrogate consent). CSF sampling limited to 3 timed points weekly during initial 2 weeks, using small-volume aliquots (≤2 mL) obtained during clinically indicated procedures under ultrasound guidance. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviews safety monthly. Secondary endpoints include modified Rankin Scale at 6 months, CSF inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α), and blood-brain barrier integrity assessments (CSF:serum albumin ratio).",

Atherosclerosis is initiated by endothelium activation and, followed by a cascade of events (accumulation of lipids, fibrous elements, and calcification), triggers the vessel narrowing and activation of inflammatory pathways. The resultant atheroma plaque, along with these processes, results in cardiovascular complications. This review focuses on the different stages of atherosclerosis development, ranging from endothelial dysfunction to plaque rupture.

Introduction\n\nAtherosclerosis is a disease that is characterized by the accumulation of lipids, fibrous elements, and calcification within the large arteries. This process is initiated by endothelium activation, followed by a cascade of events, which implies the vessel narrowing and activation of inflammatory pathways leading to atheroma plaque formation. Altogether, these processes result in cardiovascular complications that remain as the leading cause of death worldwide.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to review the mechanism of development of atherosclerosis, including endothelial dysfunction, fatty streak formation, fibrous plaque formation, and plaque rupture. This review approaches the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis from a broad perspective, examining the pathological and biochemical processes of atherosclerotic plaque formation and growth. In addition, this review summarizes the current understanding of the involvement of microRNAs and lncRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation and modulation of atheroma plaque and atherogenesis. Non-traditional drivers of atherosclerosis-such as disturbed sleep, physical inactivity, the microbiome, the role of microbiota, and the importance of sex as a crucial risk factor in atherosclerosis are covered here in order to provide a global view of the disease.\n\n# 2. Endothelium \n\nThe vascular endothelium is a heterogeneous monolayer formed by endothelial cells (ECs), which face the luminal side of all blood vessels, representing the first barrier for molecules, cells, or pathogens circulating in the bloodstream [1]. In large vessels, the vessel wall is lined with a single EC layer called the endothelium, which, together with collagen and elastic fibers, forms the luminal layer of the vessels or the intima. ECs are in intimate contact with tunica media consisting of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and elastic and collagenous tissue. Finally, surrounding this layer is tunica adventitia, which is composed mainly of a dense matrix of connective tissue. On the other hand, the walls of arterioles and venules are composed of the same three layers as the larger vessels, although the media and adventitia are much thinner and less pronounced. Finally, post-capillary venules completely lack media and adventitia and only consist of ECs and a basement membrane [2].\n\nEndothelium is strategically located between circulating blood and tissues, working as a sensor and transducer of signals by the production of biologically active substances. All changes in circulating blood are perceived by the endothelium, which then mediates signal transduction to the other layers of the vascular wall. Such changes include mechanical stress (elongation and wall shear stress (WSS)), as well as changes in the concentration of metabolic factors.\nAn accumulation of cholesterol in the subendothelial compartment also promotes the formation of cholesterol crystals both inside and outside the cells and contributes to the development of atherosclerotic plaques [157,158,159]. This process has been monitored both outside and inside the cells, in macrophages incubated with oxLDLs [160]. Although cholesterol crystals are a common feature of advanced atherosclerotic lesions, they are present also in early plaques and can be used as a marker of early atherosclerosis development [161]. Cholesterol crystals within the plaque activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes of the innate immune system responsible for the activation of inflammatory pathways [162]. Although NLRP3 activation and assembly is not fully understood, it is known that its activation leads to caspase-1 activation. Caspase-1 subsequently cleaves the proinflammatory IL-1 family of cytokines into their bioactive forms, IL-1β and IL-18, contributing to inflammation [88]. It has been suggested that uptake of oxLDLs mediated by the CD36 receptor is responsible for NLRP3 activation [88]. Apparently, the CD36 scavenger receptor, along with TLR4-TLR6, takes up oxLDL, which results in intracellular cholesterol crystals. These crystals cause lysosomal destabilization [163], inducing the release of lysosomal contents, such as cathepsins or reactive oxygen species [164], leading to NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and the subsequent activation of caspase-1.\n\n### 3.5. Contribution of VSMCs to Foam Cell Population\n\nVSMCs located in the intima are also able to internalize oxLDL in a non-regulated way through different scavenger receptors, such as SR-A, CD36, and LOX-1 [165,166,167,168,169]. Indeed, their contribution to the sum of foam cell population within the plaque is significant [20]. In addition, VSMCs of the intima express fewer ABCA1 transporters than the ones of the tunica media [170]. Therefore, the balance between cholesterol input and output is tilted in favor of cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation. At least 50% of the foam cells in the human coronary intima are VSMC-derived rather than monocyte-derived, underlying the importance of VSMCs in atherosclerosis development [170].\n\n## 4. Fibrous Plaque Development\n\nDuring fibrous plaque development, atheroma plaques undergo a transition from the fatty streak to intimal growing, a step characterized by the presence of a cell-free and lipid-rich area known as the necrotic core (Figure 3). To stabilize the plaque, the necrotic core is covered by fibers, thus developing a fibrous cap. The necrotic core and the fibrous cap constitute the hallmark of advanced atherosclerosis [171], and atheroma plaque regression is unlikely to happen in this stage [172,173].\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 3.** Schematic representation of atheroma plaque formation from a healthy artery to plaque rupture underlying the most important events that contribute to its development in each stage.\n\n### 4.1. Fibrous Cap\n\nThe fibrous cap is a subendothelial barrier between the lumen of the vessel and the atherosclerotic necrotic core consisting of VSMCs that have migrated to the luminal side of the artery and extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from VSMCs [174,175]. The role of the fibrous cap is to serve as a structural support to avoid the exposure of prothrombotic material of the core that otherwise would trigger thrombosis [174].\n\nAt the physiological situation, differentiated VSMCs of the tunica media show a contractile phenotype that regulates the blood vessel diameter and blood flow [176,177,178]. However, in response to injury, VSMCs switch their phenotype to the synthetic one in which migratory and proliferation activities prevail [179,180]. For that purpose, neighboring cells activate the healing process by producing several growth factors, which include epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [179]. In atherosclerosis, in response to the growth factors produced by foam cells (VSMC- or macrophage-derived) or ECs of the intima, VSMCs from the tunica media migrate to the intima [175,179,181,182,183]. Moreover, IL-1 produced by macrophages enhances the endogenous production of PDGF by VSMC, and, once in the intima, it autocrinically leads to their proliferation [184,185]. In addition to migration and subsequent\n\nproliferation, VSMCs with a synthetic phenotype also increase the production of ECM components, such as interstitial collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans [183,186,187,188]. These proliferating VSMCs, along with ECM production, generate a fibrous cap that will cover the developing atherosclerotic plaque, thus surrounding the lesion and preventing its rupture [189]. Interestingly, if the mitogen production does not cease, VSMCs do not switch back to the contractile phenotype [176,177,190,191], which facilitates lesion development. Fibrous-cap features, such as thickness, cellularity, matrix composition, and collagen content, are important determinants of plaque stability [192,193,194].\n\n### 4.2. Necrotic Core\nDifferent mechanical forces acting on the arterial wall modulate several physiological functions, such as the regulation of homeostasis, vascular tone, and vascular integrity. Apart from their role in homeostasis, the involvement of hemodynamics in vascular disease development has been shown to be crucial in the pathology of atherosclerosis, affecting both disease onset and progression. The main forces acting on the arterial wall include both tensile stress induced by blood pressure and WSS, a tangential force to the vessel wall induced by blood flow that plays an important role in atherogenic hemodynamics [3].\n\nVessel segments with low WSS or highly oscillatory WSS appear to be at the highest risk for development of atherosclerosis [4,5]. WSS change can directly affect the morphology and function of the vascular endothelium and stimulate the migration and proliferation of VSMCs and mononuclear cells [6]. Whether low or unstable, changing WSS is an indicator to evaluate hemodynamic changes that are closely related to atherosclerosis [7,8].\n\nThe magnitude and direction of WSS are recognized by mechanosensors on the endothelium and are transduced as biochemical signaling. WSS-induced mechanotransduction regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cell morphology, adhesion, and proliferation.\n\nFor example, shear stress induces characteristic EC alignment [9,10] (Figure 1A). In tubular or straight regions of arteries, where the WSS presents a laminar flow, ECs show a flattened shape and an elongated alignment in the direction of the flow [11]. However, at the bifurcation or high vessel curvature sites, flow disturbance occurs and, as a consequence of the turbulent and reversal flow with lowered WSS at the outer vessel wall, ECs augment their volume by adopting a cobblestone appearance [12] (Figure 1A). Moreover, hemodynamic forces determine the early development of localized atherosclerotic plaques that are not randomly distributed, neither in experimental animal models nor in humans [13,14]. Atherosclerotic lesions mainly occur in regions characterized by low WSS and flow separation (Figure 1B) and most frequently involve branch points and bifurcations. The extensive correlative data indicating that low shear or disrupted flow accounts for the localization of atherosclerosis lesions emphasize the importance of arterial branches and bifurcations when performing a diagnosis of atherosclerotic lesion development or progression.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 1.** Effect of flow and WSS patterns at arterial bifurcations on atherosclerotic plaque development. (**A**) In straight vessel segments, physiological WSS with laminar flow leads to ECs and shows a quiescent characteristic flattened shape when flow disturbance occurs. Lower WSS at the outer vessel wall causes ECs to adopt a cobblestone appearance. (**B**) Turbulent flow occurs at bifurcations and branch points where the arterial curvature is higher due to flow separation. Disturbed laminar flow or turbulent flow reduces WSS and promotes endothelial dysfunction and LDL infiltration, which constitutes the first step of atheroma plaque formation. On the contrary, low curvature areas of the vascular system subjected to higher shear stress are athero-protected.\n\nEndothelium modulates the tone of underlying vascular smooth muscle; maintains a non-adhesive luminal surface; and mediates hemostasis, cellular proliferation, and inflammatory and immune response in the vascular wall [15]. In fact, endothelium releases both agonists and antagonists in order to balance the effect in both directions. For instance, ECs are able to produce both coagulants or anti-coagulants, vasodilators or vasoconstrictors and pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory molecules [15,16].\n\n### 3. Atherosclerosis Initiation and Fatty Streak Formation\n\nAtherosclerosis initiates upon endothelial dysfunction accompanied by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) retention and its modification in the intima [17,18]. Modified LDLs,\n\ntogether with additional atherogenic factors, promote the activation of ECs, leading to monocyte recruitment within the intima. Modified LDLs are avidly captured by differentiated monocytes and VSMC, which promote foam cell formation [19,20]. In addition, several inflammatory signaling pathways are activated, allowing the fatty streak formation, which represents the first sign of atherosclerosis and is characterized by a substantial accumulation of lipids both within the cells (macrophages and VSMC) and the extracellular media [21].\n\n### 3.1. Endothelial Dysfunction in Atherosclerosis Development\n\nDisruption of the mechanisms involved in vascular homeostasis regulation leads to endothelial dysfunction [9,12,22]. Briefly, when ECs lose their ability to maintain homeostasis, vessel walls are predisposed to vasoconstriction, lipid infiltration, leukocyte adhesion, platelet activation, and oxidative stress, among other things [23,24]. Together, these induce an inflammatory response that is considered the first step of atheromatous plaque formation: the fatty streak [12,22]. In addition, endothelial dysfunction also plays a remarkable role in subsequent steps of atherosclerosis by participating in plaque development and in its rupture in the last steps of atherosclerosis [22]. Therefore, an increased endothelial dysfunction is considered an early indicator of atherogenesis [25,26].\n\n### 3.1.1. Hemodynamic Forces and Endothelial Dysfunction\n",

                "hypothesis": "In early atherogenesis at arterial bifurcations, low/oscillatory wall shear stress (WSS) induces endothelial dysfunction and upregulates the scavenger receptor CD36 specifically in endothelial cells. This primed endothelial CD36 serves as a critical, non-redundant platform for the initial capture and local concentration of oxidized LDL (oxLDL), which is subsequently transferred to intimal macrophages. This transfer potently amplifies CD36/TLR4-TLR6-mediated oxLDL uptake in macrophages, leading to enhanced intracellular cholesterol crystal formation, lysosomal destabilization, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation beyond levels triggered by oxLDL alone. This novel endothelial-macrophage relay mechanism creates a spatially focused, positive feedback loop that explains the accelerated and localized nature of plaque initiation at sites of disturbed flow.",
                "mechanism_explanation": "The revised hypothesis addresses the feedback by proposing a specific, non-obvious interaction within the canonical cascade. 1) At bifurcations, low/oscillatory WSS causes endothelial cobblestone morphology and dysfunction. 2) Crucially, this specific hemodynamic stimulus transcriptionally upregulates CD36 expression in the dysfunctional endothelium (a novel, testable link). 3) The upregulated endothelial CD36 acts as a 'molecular sink,' binding and concentrating circulating oxLDL at the lesion-prone site. 4) Through a trans-cellular process (e.g., via extracellular vesicles or direct contact), this endothelial-bound oxLDL is transferred to resident intimal macrophages. 5) This transfer delivers a high local concentration of ligand to macrophage CD36/TLR4-TLR6 complexes, dramatically potentiating downstream signaling (cholesterol crystal formation, lysosomal damage) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation compared to systemic oxLDL uptake. 6) The resulting burst of IL-1β/IL-18 further exacerbates endothelial dysfunction and recruits more monocytes, establishing a vicious cycle. This framework integrates modulators: microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g., TMAO) may synergize by further upregulating endothelial CD36, and specific lncRNAs (e.g., MALAT1) may regulate this CD36 priming step. The model is distinct from prior syntheses by identifying endothelial CD36 upregulation as a flow-sensitive 'gatekeeper' that amplifies, rather than merely initiates, the inflammatory response.",

Primary quantitative endpoints (predicted changes vs. control): 1) Plaque area at ligated carotid (µMRI/histology): Expected >50% reduction in groups i, ii, iii. 2) Necrotic core size (% of plaque area): Expected >60% reduction. 3) Active caspase-1+ cells in plaque (flow cytometry): Expected >70% reduction. 4) Endothelial CD36 protein expression (immunofluorescence): Confirmed upregulation in control ligated artery, absent in group ii. Complementary in vitro test: Use a microfluidic chamber to subject human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to oscillatory vs. laminar shear. After 48h, add fluorescently labeled oxLDL with or without a CD36-blocking peptide. Then, introduce THP-1-derived macrophages into the chamber. Measure: (a) oxLDL transfer from HAECs to macrophages (fluorescence microscopy/flow cytometry) – predicted 3-fold increase under oscillatory shear, blocked by CD36 inhibition; (b) Macrophage NLRP3 activation (caspase-1 cleavage assay). Validation in humans: Correlate endothelial CD36 expression (from carotid endarterectomy samples) with local WSS patterns (from preoperative MRI) and plaque inflammation markers (histology).

The context provides mechanistic depth: epicardial fat is a source of inflammatory mediators (ref 118) and has altered adipokine expression (ref 111, 113).

                "hypothesis": "Cardiovascular diseases and endothelial dysfunction are mechanistically linked through a pathological axis originating from dysfunctional epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), which, via its altered secretome (reduced adiponectin, increased inflammatory mediators), promotes endothelial oxidative stress, reduces nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and impairs shear stress-responsive transcriptional regulation (e.g., of eNOS and PECAM-1), thereby disrupting endothelial barrier function, enhancing lipoprotein transcytosis (potentially via caveolin-1-mediated pathways), and initiating atherosclerotic plaque formation, with this cascade being exacerbated by conditions like hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.",
                "mechanism_explanation": "The provided contexts describe a cohesive biological narrative: 1) Epicardial/perivascular adipose tissue (EAT/PVAT) exhibits a proinflammatory phenotype in cardiovascular disease (CVD) states, with reduced protective adipokines (e.g., adiponectin) and increased inflammatory mediators (Mazurek et al., 2003; Baker et al., 2006; Chatterjee et al., 2009). 2) This dysfunctional secretome contributes to endothelial dysfunction, a key early event in atherosclerosis. 3) Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by oxidative stress and reduced NO bioavailability (Förstermann et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018), which impairs vasodilation (Archer et al., 1994; Casino et al., 1993). 4) NO production is regulated by shear stress via transcriptional mechanisms involving specific promoters (Davis et al., 2004; Houston et al., 1999). 5) A dysfunctional endothelium has impaired barrier function, facilitating the transcytosis of atherogenic lipoproteins across the endothelium, a process potentially involving caveolae and caveolin-1 (Jang et al., 2020; Fernández-Hernando et al., 2009). 6) Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are both causes and consequences of this endothelial dysfunction (Alexander, 1995; Landmesser et al., 2000), and are associated with increased EAT thickness (Dicker et al., 2013; Eroğlu et al., 2013). Thus, the contexts collectively support a hypothesis where dysfunctional EAT acts as a central pathogenic organ that disrupts multiple, interconnected endothelial homeostatic mechanisms.",
                "experimental_suggestion": "Utilize a co-culture system of human epicardial adipocytes (from patients with and without CVD) and primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) under controlled shear stress. Measure: 1) Secretome profile of adipocytes (adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-α). 2) Endothelial NO production, oxidative stress markers, and eNOS promoter activity using a reporter construct. 3) Endothelial monolayer integrity (transendothelial electrical resistance) and LDL transcytosis rates. 4) The role of caveolin-1 via siRNA knockdown in HAECs. Validate key findings in a murine model of diet-induced obesity with/without surgical EAT removal, assessing endothelial function (aortic ring vasodilation), atherosclerotic burden, and vascular inflammation.",
                "relevance_to_query": "This comprehensive hypothesis directly addresses the query by synthesizing multiple factors implicated in the relationship between cardiovascular diseases and endothelial dysfunction. It identifies a central factor (dysfunctional epicardial adipose tissue) and delineates the downstream mechanistic pathways through which it influences endothelial health, including altered adipokine secretion, oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, shear stress response, and vascular barrier function, thereby providing an integrated answer to what factors are involved.",

However, the core components (EAT inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, NO bioavailability) are individually well-documented, making this a moderate, synthetic novelty.",

This EAT-origin axis predicts that: 1) EAT-derived factors suppress shear-stress-responsive transcriptional programs (e.g., eNOS promoter activity) before systemic inflammation manifests, 2) this transcriptional dysregulation, combined with oxidative stress, reduces NO bioavailability and impairs vasodilation, 3) the compromised endothelial barrier facilitates increased transcytosis of atherogenic lipoproteins via multiple pathways including, but not limited to, caveolin-1-mediated mechanisms, and 4) endothelial-derived factors feedback to further polarize EAT toward inflammation, creating a vicious cycle that accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation. This framework differs from systemic models by positing EAT as the primary pathogenic organ whose dysfunction is necessary and sufficient to trigger the cascade in metabolic syndrome contexts.",
                "mechanism_explanation": "The revised mechanism explicitly addresses feedback: 1) In cardiovascular disease states, EAT/PVAT exhibits reduced protective adipokines (adiponectin) and increased inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-α), creating a dysfunctional secretome (Mazurek et al., 2003; Baker et al., 2006). 2) This secretome directly impairs endothelial shear-stress sensing—we predict EAT-derived factors suppress shear-stress-responsive promoters (e.g., eNOS via NF-κB) based on known cytokine effects on endothelial transcription (Davis et al., 2004; Silberman et al., 2009). 3) Concurrently, the secretome induces endothelial oxidative stress, further reducing NO bioavailability (Förstermann et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018), which impairs vasodilation (Archer et al., 1994). 4) The dysfunctional endothelium exhibits impaired barrier integrity, facilitating transcytosis of atherogenic lipoproteins via mechanisms potentially involving, but not limited to, caveolin-1 pathways (Jang et al., 2020; Fernández-Hernando et al., 2009). 5) Endothelial-derived factors (e.g., oxidized lipids, cytokines) feedback to further polarize EAT toward a proinflammatory phenotype, creating a vicious cycle. 6) Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia both exacerbate and result from this cycle (Alexander, 1995; Landmesser et al., 2000), with increased EAT thickness serving as a marker (Dicker et al., 2013). The hypothesis is specifically proposed as a major driver in obesity- and metabolic syndrome-associated atherosclerosis, predicting that a shift in the EAT adiponectin-to-TNF-α ratio beyond a critical threshold is necessary to disrupt endothelial homeostasis.",

        ],
        "contexts": "MEND is a nanoparticle in which siRNA is entrapped in the inner phase of a lipid bilayer modified with functional molecules such as peptides. Also, pH-responsive lipids can be incorporated into the lipid membranes to control their intracellular traficking116. For example, a GALA-MEND has been recently designed and optimized by incorporating a pH-responsive lipid (YSK05) to deliver CD31 siRNA to the pulmonary endothelium based on GALA peptide targeting129. The incorporated YSK05 enhanced the endosomal release of the optimized MEND resulting in an improved knockdown in the lung endothelium by comparison with DOTMA or DOTAP-MENDs when intravenously injected into mice. Furthermore, the incorporated helper lipids such as DOPE synergistically enhanced both the selectivity and efficiency of the designed MEND129. Thus, GALA modified MEND may be a potential carrier of siRNA in curing various lung diseases including ALI/ARDS128.\n\n#### Exosomes (EXOs)\n\nEXOs are endogenous extracellular nanovesicles deriving from the endosomal system with a particle size ranging from 30 to 150 nm. EXOs are released by various types of cells into the extracellular environment as nature's nano delivery system of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, playing an important role in intercellular communication133, 134, 135^{,}143.\n\nInterestingly, Zhang et al.93 used serum-derived exosomes as vehicles to deliver siRNA against Myd88 (involved in innate immune signaling) to the lung. siRNAs were first loaded into serum EXOs via modified calcium-mediated transfection and then were intratracheally instilled in LPS-induced ALI mouse model. Efficiently, the siRNA-carriers were internalized by AMs, achieved specific gene silencing, and modulated LPS-induced inflammation. More interestingly, serum-derived EXOs themselves were neither inflammogenic nor immunogenic when delivered into the lung. Curiously, the intratracheally instilled EXOs were only taken up by AMs, but not by LPS-activated neutrophils. Accordingly, the delivery of EXO-based siRNA to other lung cells, such as EpiCs, requires the development of new methods to avoid their uptake by AMs93.Another study suggests that exosomes of human induced pluripotent stem cells with a size of 122 nm isolated by differential centrifugation, could be used as a natural delivery system of ICAM-1 siRNA to inhibit the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) protein expression in HMVECs (Human primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells). Exosomes were successfully internalized by LPS activated HMVECs, leading to selective suppression of ICAM-1 surface expression in vitro which may alleviate ALI in vivo144. Based on those findings, EXOs seem like an attractive candidate for siRNA delivery because of their natural potential to carry genetic material, their native biocompatibility with low inherent immunogenicity and toxicity in comparison with exogenous carriers130, 131, 132. Furthermore, they can potentially evade the endosomal pathway and lysosomal degradation134. However, their purification techniques are cumbersome and expensive for large-scale manufacturing131^{,}133.\n\n### Polymer-based delivery vectors\n\nPolymer-based vectors are attractive candidates for siRNA delivery systems because of their facile synthesis and lower immunogenicity compared to liposomes145. Generally, polymer-based carriers can be separated into two categories: polycations and polymeric nanoparticles.\n\n#### Polycations\n\nSimilar to lipoplexes, polyplexes or dendriplexes are formed by electrostatic interactions between their cationic amine (N) groups and the anionic phosphate (P) groups of nucleic acids. They include synthetic polycations such as polyethylenimine (PEI), polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers, and natural polycations such as chitosan146. The transfection efficiency of cationic polymers is influenced by their structure, size, and surface charge. Also, the degree of complexation quantified by the N/P ratio affects the net charge, size, and stability of the delivery system147. Typically, an excess of the polymer is needed to generate stable cationic vehicles and facilitate their internalization148. However, an excessively high positive charge may cause cytotoxicity149. Hence, an appropriate N/P ratio should be found for each system to assure the balance between transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity147. The polycations internalized by the clathrin-dependent pathway use the “proton sponge” effect to escape from endosomes150. The proton sponges cationic polymers, such as PEI and PAMAM, prevent acidification of endocytic vesicles owing to their high buffering capacity inciting the membranes H^{+}-ATPases to actively translocate H^{+} from the cytoplasm into the endosome to maintain the desired pH. The increased protonation causes an influx of chloride and water into the endosome leading to disruption of the endosomal membrane, and eventually endosomal escape of the endocytosed polyplexes into the cytosol150, 151, 152.\n\nAlthough PEI has an excellent gene condensation ability, high buffering capacity leading to great endosome escape activity, and\n\nhigh transfection efficiency153, it suffers from molecular weight-dependent cytotoxicity and nonbiodegradability hindering its application as an effective delivery system154. The positive charge of PEI has been incriminated in necrotic and apoptotic cell death both in vitro and in vivo152. Also, it has been demonstrated that linear PEIs are less toxic than their branched counterparts155.\n\n##### Polyplexes\n",

This synergy is hypothesized to arise from the exosome shell specifically modulating the immunogenic profile of the cationic GALA-MEND core, enabling a unique biodistribution pattern with enhanced endothelial accumulation while minimizing macrophage clearance, which neither component achieves alone.",

The novel synergistic prediction is that exosome encapsulation will shield the cationic nanoparticle surface, reducing non-specific immune activation and altering pharmacokinetics to favor endothelial over macrophage uptake, creating a non-linear improvement in targeting specificity. This approach specifically targets the well-established role of TNF-alpha in ALI/ARDS pathology (Ref: TNF-alpha in ALI models). Boundaries: This approach is hypothesized for acute lung inflammatory models via intravenous delivery; utility for chronic conditions, other organs, or other siRNAs requires separate validation.

        "contexts": "EVs also play important roles in intercellular communication in adipose tissue, however, especially when one considers that exosome miRNAs have the ability to regulate TGF-β and WNT/β-catenin signaling in obesity-induced inflammation96. Human adipocyte derived EVs are also reported to have immunomodulatory effects on macrophages, and macrophages pre-treated with human adipocyte-derived EVs secrete small EVs that interfere with adipocyte insulin signaling97. This demonstrates that there is a reciprocal regulatory loop between adipocytes and macrophages that is mediated by EVs and which affects macrophage activation and adipocyte insulin signaling that leads to adipose tissue inflammation98. This behavior is demonstrated in animal models, where adipocytes can release EVs which act as “find me” signals to promote macrophage migration and infiltration99. Additionally, miR-155 in adipocyte-derived MVs induces M1 macrophage polarization, causing chronic inflammation and local insulin resistance100. Adipocyte-secreted exosomes also transport miR-34a into macrophages, thereby suppressing M2 polarization by repressing the expression of KLF4101. Adipocyte-derived small EVs can therefore regulate macrophage infiltration and the adipose tissue M1/M2 macrophage ratio to induce obesity-related inflammation. Alteration of the disease-promoting balance between M1 and M2 adipose tissue macrophages can also contribute to the regulation of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance102. For example, Zhuge et al.103 used linaglipin, a strong DPP-4 inhibitor, to treat obesity, and found that it could reduce M1-polarized macrophage migration while inducing an M2-dominant macrophage shift within white adipose and liver tissues, thereby attenuating obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.\n\nComplementary to adipocyte mechanisms to activate macrophages, activated macrophages not only secrete inflammatory cytokines that provoke systemic and local inflammation but also release EVs to influence adipocyte activity. Exosomes from LPS-activated macrophages upregulate some of the pathways and metabolic processes related to inflammation onset in adipocytes20. These exosomes also exhibit increased levels of miR-29a, which can be transferred into hepatocytes, myocytes and adipocytes to impair the insulin sensitivity of these target cells in vitro and in vivo, ultimately promoting obesity-induced insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes104. These results indicate that activated macrophages participate in a variety of inflammation-related metabolic pathways by releasing small EVs that promote local and systemic chronic inflammation. Altering the polarization of macrophages and thus the cargoes and activities of their small EVs may improve macrophage-mediated inflammation. Melatonin serves as an example for the potential of such an approach, since it alleviates adipose inflammation both by direct actions on adipocytes and indirect activity on macrophages mediate by adipocyte-derived EVs105.\n\nCirculating EVs can thus polarize M1 macrophages to secrete small EVs that trigger pro-inflammatory responses (Fig. 3) associated with acute inflammatory responses (AP, AKI, ALI, and sepsis) that can resolve with supportive care or short-term interventions and non-resolving, chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, obesity and diabetes) that are more difficult to attenuate and regress. Small EVs can, however, also carry protein and miRNA cargoes that limit attenuate acute inflammation and promote tissue repair or limit inflammation and tissue damage during chronic inflammation conditions. Better understanding of the roles that EVs play in regulating the polarization and exerting the regulatory effects of macrophages during the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses and conditions may identify new therapeutic targets for intervention to limit excessive tissue injury. Approaches that target EV-mediated mechanisms involved in these processes may be more effective in limiting inflammation and tissue injury and have fewer side effects than approaches that attempt to attenuate macrophage accumulation or activity.\n\n## MSC EVs promote macrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype\n",

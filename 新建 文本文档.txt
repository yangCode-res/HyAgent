[{'title': 'Epicardial adipose tissue inflammation impairs endothelial function via reduced NO bioavailability', 'hypothesis': 'Increased epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness and its proinflammatory phenotype in hypertension and coronary artery disease leads to endothelial dysfunction by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability through oxidative stress mechanisms, contributing to cardiovascular disease progression.', 'mechanism_explanation': 'The context describes: 1) Epicardial adipose tissue expresses inflammatory mediators and has lower adiponectin in hypertension/CAD (refs 111, 113, 118, 122). 2) Endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemia/hypertension involves reduced NO bioavailability (refs 54, 60, 64, 65). 3) Oxidative stress impairs endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and NO signaling (refs 62, 63). 4) NO mediates vasorelaxation and is antiatherogenic (refs 55, 57). This suggests EAT-derived inflammatory factors may increase vascular oxidative stress, reducing NO production/function.', 'experimental_suggestion': 'Measure NO production (via DAF-FM fluorescence or nitrite/nitrate levels) and superoxide production (via DHE staining) in human aortic endothelial cells treated with conditioned media from epicardial vs. subcutaneous adipose tissue explants from patients with/without hypertension.

Adiponectin is known to enhance eNOS activation; its reduction in EAT may locally blunt shear-sensitive eNOS upregulation.', 'experimental_suggestion': 'Apply physiological shear stress to human coronary artery endothelial cells treated with recombinant adiponectin vs. control, then measure eNOS promoter activity (luciferase reporter), eNOS mRNA/protein, and NO production.

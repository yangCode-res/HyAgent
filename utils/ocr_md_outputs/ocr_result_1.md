Cardiovascular diseases represent the principal cause of death and comorbidity among people with diabetes. Ferroptosis, an iron- dependent non- apoptotic regulated cellular death characterized by lipid peroxidation, is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular diseases. The susceptibility to ferroptosis in diabetic hearts is possibly related to myocardial iron accumulation, abnormal lipid metabolism and excess oxidative stress under hyperglycemia conditions. Accumulating evidence suggests ferroptosis can be the therapeutic target for diabetic cardiovascular diseases. This review summarizes ferroptosis- related mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular diseases and novel therapeutic choices targeting ferroptosis- related pathways. Further study on ferroptosis- mediated cardiac injury can enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiovascular diseases and provide more potential therapeutic choices.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) has emerged as one of the most common and serious chronic diseases of our times [1, 2]. Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which remain the major cause of death among diabetic patients [3- 5]. And the risk increases progressively with elevated fasting plasma glucose level, even before it reaches the sufficient level for the diagnosis of diabetes, which is referred to as prediabetes [4, 6, 7]. The known mechanism of diabetes- induced cardiac dysfunction includes oxidative stress, inflammation,  

abnormalities in substrate utilization, mitochondrial dysfunction, advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation, changes at the level of insulin signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress and cardiac cell death [8, 9].  

Ferroptosis is an iron- dependent non- apoptotic cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation [10]. Ferroptosis is distinct from other forms of regulated cell death (RCD) such as apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy and pyroptosis [10, 11]. Several remarkable features distinguish ferroptosis from other forms of RCD (Table 1 [12- 22]). Ferroptosis is initiated without the involvement of death receptors, differentiating it from other RCD processes such as apoptosis [23]. Lipid peroxidation within cellular membranes induced by iron dysregulation is another characteristic of ferroptosis, which promotes the production and release of cytotoxic adducts, impairing the integrity of the plasma membrane and cellular functionality [23]. Cells undergoing ferroptosis display the feature of damaged sub- cellular architecture, with shrunken and dense mitochondria [11]. Growing evidence has supported the notion that ferroptosis has a

pathophysiological role in the development of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [24, 25].  

Accumulating evidence has indicated ferroptosis is involved in diabetic heart [26- 28], and therapeutic choices for diabetes- related CVDs targeting ferroptosis- related pathways have been emerging [29- 31]. However, reviews summarizing the possible role of ferroptosis in full spectrum of diabetic cardiovascular diseases are scarce. Therefore, this review aims to delineate the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis and its association with diabetes- related cardiovascular diseases, hoping to help the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies.  

Ferroptosis was initially introduced in 2012 as a unique form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by the overwhelming, iron- dependent accumulation of lethal lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could be triggered by erastin and inhibited by ferrostatin- 1 [10]. With deeper insight into the field of ferroptosis, the complicated regulatory mechanism involving a variety of signaling molecules and metabolic pathways of ferroptosis has been gradually unveiled [11, 24, 32]. The initiation and execution of ferroptosis lies at the intersection of iron, lipid and glutathione metabolism [12, 24, 33]. A brief overview of the regulatory mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1.

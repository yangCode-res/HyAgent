Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides novel insights into the tumor microenvironment (TME). ST allows the quantification and illustration of gene expression profiles in the spatial context of tissues, including both the cancer cells and the microenvironment in which they are found. In cancer research, ST has already provided novel insights into cancer metastasis, prognosis, and immunotherapy responsiveness. The clinical precision oncology application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and RNA profiling of tumors relies on bulk methods that lack spatial context. The ability to preserve spatial information is now possible, as it allows us to capture tumor heterogeneity and multifocality. In this narrative review, we summarize precision oncology, discuss tumor sequencing in the clinic, and review the available ST research methods, including seqFISH, MERFISH (Vizgen), CosMx SMI (NanoString), Xenium (10x), Visium (10x), Stereo-seq (STOmics), and GeoMx DSP (NanoString). We then review the current ST literature with a focus on solid tumors organized by tumor type. Finally, we conclude by addressing an important question: how will spatial transcriptomics ultimately help patients with cancer?

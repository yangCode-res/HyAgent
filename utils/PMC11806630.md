## Abstract  

Cardiovascular diseases represent the principal cause of death and comorbidity among people with diabetes. Ferroptosis, an iron- dependent non- apoptotic regulated cellular death characterized by lipid peroxidation, is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular diseases. The susceptibility to ferroptosis in diabetic hearts is possibly related to myocardial iron accumulation, abnormal lipid metabolism and excess oxidative stress under hyperglycemia conditions. Accumulating evidence suggests ferroptosis can be the therapeutic target for diabetic cardiovascular diseases. This review summarizes ferroptosis- related mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular diseases and novel therapeutic choices targeting ferroptosis- related pathways. Further study on ferroptosis- mediated cardiac injury can enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiovascular diseases and provide more potential therapeutic choices.  

Keywords Ferroptosis, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases, Mechanism, Therapeutic targets  

Diabetes mellitus (DM) has emerged as one of the most common and serious chronic diseases of our times [1, 2]. Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which remain the major cause of death among diabetic patients [3- 5]. And the risk increases progressively with elevated fasting plasma glucose level, even before it reaches the sufficient level for the diagnosis of diabetes, which is referred to as prediabetes [4, 6, 7]. The known mechanism of diabetes- induced cardiac dysfunction includes oxidative stress, inflammation,  

abnormalities in substrate utilization, mitochondrial dysfunction, advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation, changes at the level of insulin signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress and cardiac cell death [8, 9].  

Ferroptosis is an iron- dependent non- apoptotic cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation [10]. Ferroptosis is distinct from other forms of regulated cell death (RCD) such as apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy and pyroptosis [10, 11]. Several remarkable features distinguish ferroptosis from other forms of RCD (Table 1 [12- 22]). Ferroptosis is initiated without the involvement of death receptors, differentiating it from other RCD processes such as apoptosis [23]. Lipid peroxidation within cellular membranes induced by iron dysregulation is another characteristic of ferroptosis, which promotes the production and release of cytotoxic adducts, impairing the integrity of the plasma membrane and cellular functionality [23]. Cells undergoing ferroptosis display the feature of damaged sub- cellular architecture, with shrunken and dense mitochondria [11]. Growing evidence has supported the notion that ferroptosis has a

pathophysiological role in the development of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [24, 25].  

Accumulating evidence has indicated ferroptosis is involved in diabetic heart [26- 28], and therapeutic choices for diabetes- related CVDs targeting ferroptosis- related pathways have been emerging [29- 31]. However, reviews summarizing the possible role of ferroptosis in full spectrum of diabetic cardiovascular diseases are scarce. Therefore, this review aims to delineate the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis and its association with diabetes- related cardiovascular diseases, hoping to help the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies.  

Ferroptosis was initially introduced in 2012 as a unique form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by the overwhelming, iron- dependent accumulation of lethal lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could be triggered by erastin and inhibited by ferrostatin- 1 [10]. With deeper insight into the field of ferroptosis, the complicated regulatory mechanism involving a variety of signaling molecules and metabolic pathways of ferroptosis has been gradually unveiled [11, 24, 32]. The initiation and execution of ferroptosis lies at the intersection of iron, lipid and glutathione metabolism [12, 24, 33]. A brief overview of the regulatory mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1.  

Iron in and out of cells is balanced by the iron transport system. Ceruloplasmin oxidizes ferrous iron \(\mathrm{(Fe^{2 + })}\) from red blood cell degradation or intestinal absorption to ferric iron \(\mathrm{(Fe^{3 + })}\) , which has a high affinity for the soluble  

<center>Fig.1 Schematic representation of the mechanism of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is primarily driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Transferrin-bound ferric iron \(\mathrm{(Fe3 + )}\) is imported through the transferrin receptor (TfR) and then converted to ferrous iron \(\mathrm{(Fe2 + )}\) in endosomes, which is then released via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). \(\mathrm{Fe2 + }\) imported through DMT1, degradation of heme catalyzed by heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated ferritinophagy can also increase the cellular labile iron pool (LIP). Iron is mainly stored in the form of ferritin, which exerts a protective effect against Fenton reaction. Excess \(\mathrm{Fe2 + }\) is converted into \(\mathrm{Fe3 + }\) via Fenton reaction, which induces lipid peroxidation by activating lipoxygenases (LOXs). The peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing phospholipids in cell membrane is an essential step in ferroptosis. PUFA is catalyzed into the acylated form (PUFA-CoA) by the enzyme long-chain fatty acid CoA ligase 4 (LACS4). PUFA-CoA is then converted by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) to polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipid (PUFA-PL), which is oxidized by non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases LOXs to confer lipid peroxidation. The peroxidation of phospholipids is also kept in check by the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)-coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) system. System \(\mathrm{Xc}^-\) mediates the import of cystine and the export of glutamate. Cystine is subsequently converted into cysteine, which generates glutathione (GSH). GSH acts as the cofactor of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), protecting against lipid peroxidation </center>

serum protein transferrin, the main carrier of iron for distribution throughout the body [34, 35]. Transferrin binds to its receptor (TfR) and triggers clathrin- dependent endocytosis of the entire holo- transferrin complex [36]. The ferric iron is then reduced to ferrous iron by the STEAP (six- transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate) family of metal loreductases and released from the endosome into the cytoplasm via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) [34]. Non- transferrin- mediated iron uptake occurs through L/T- type calcium channels [37, 38], zinc transporters, and DMT1 [39]. Ferrous iron is oxidized to its ferric state by cytoplasmic ferritin, which exerts a protective function against Fenton reaction and ferroptosis [40]. Accumulating ferritin can be degraded by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) mediated ferritinophagy, and heme can be degraded by heme oxygenase 1(HO- 1), which together increase labile iron pool (LIP) [24]. The ferrous iron can be removed from the cell by the ferrous iron exporter, ferroportin [39]. Hepcidin, a bioactive, mature 25 amino acid peptide secreted by hepatocyte, binds to ferroportin, and triggers its internalization, ubiquitination, and subsequent lysosomal degradation [41]. Excess ferrous iron is converted to ferric iron through Fenton reaction, which promotes lipid peroxidation by activating lipoxygenases (LOXs) [13, 25].  

The peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)- containing phospholipids in cell membranes is an essential step in ferroptosis in mammalian cells [42]. PUFA can be catalyzed into the acylated form (PUFA- CoA) by the enzyme long- chain fatty acid CoA ligase 4 (LACS4) [43]. PUFA- CoA is then converted by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) to polyunsaturated fatty acid- containing phospholipid (PUFA- PL), which is oxidized by non- heme iron- dependent dioxygenases LOXs to confer lipid peroxidation [32]. The peroxidation of phospholipids can also be suppressed by the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)- coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) system [24].  

Most cells obtain cysteine primarily from the cysteineglutamate antiporter system Xc- also known as xCT), which consists of the solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). The expression of SLC7A11 can be upregulated by the transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2 (NRF2) under conditions of cellular stress [44]. System Xc- exports intracellular glutamate and imports extracellular cystine at a 1:1 ratio, and cystine is then converted to cysteine which subsequently generates glutathione (GSH), an essential cofactor for glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) function [45, 46]. GPX4 plays an indispensable role in the regulation of ferroptosis, scavenging the harmful by- products of iron- dependent lipid peroxidation, thereby protecting the cell against ferroptosis [11, 33].  

## Abnormal iron deposition in the diabetic cardiovascular system  

Iron is an essential element involved in many fundamental metabolic processes including oxygen transportation, cell growth and differentiation and DNA synthesis in cells and organisms [47]. However, excess iron in cardiomyocytes has been shown to induce ferroptosis via the accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides in the cell membrane [48]. Abnormal myocardial iron deposition has been observed in diabetic hearts.  

A clinical study using cardiovascular T2- star (T2\\*) magnetic resonance showed increased myocardial iron deposition in severe diabetic heart failure (DHF) patients compared with healthy people and non- severe DHF patients [49]. Increased myocardial iron deposition was found to be related to declined cardiac ejection fraction [49, 50]. Since the heart is very sensitive to iron overload, even low iron deposition can cause great harm to cardiomyocytes despite a small change in iron status of patients with severe DHF [51]. Lechner et al. observed persistent infarct core iron and a lower likelihood of iron resolution assessed by T2\\* mapping of cardiac magnetic resonance at 4 months after infarction in patients treated with primary PCI, and its independent association with ongoing dysglycaemia defined by HbA1c, suggesting acute and chronic pathophysiological processes leading to persistent core iron in prediabetic and diabetic hearts [52]. In addition, the beneficial effect of reducing iron content by deferoxamine, an iron chelator, was also verified in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients [53]. Deferoxamine ameliorated coronary microcirculation and restored the normal matching between myocardial metabolic demand and coronary flow, which might be attributed to the inhibition of iron- catalyzed oxidative reactions in diabetic hearts [53].  

A few preclinical studies have also observed higher levels of iron content in the cardiovascular system of diabetic animal models compared with normal glucose counterparts [31, 54- 56]. Iron overload caused heavy granular iron deposits in parenchymal cells with higher area in the heart of diabetic than control rats, and a significant positive correlation was found between ROS production and cardiac iron stores [57]. The potential influence of glucose metabolism on iron can also be supported by the observation that the iron content in the myocardium may change with the progression of diabetes. A study in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mice suggested that cardiac labile iron level decreased at the first week of diabetes and then gradually increased from the second week of diabetes, and the genes related to ferroptosis and lipid peroxidation also demonstrated similar patterns [58]. In a diabetic atherosclerosis monkey model, increased whole- body iron stores and arterial iron deposition were observed, with elevated circulating lipid

peroxides, within a month of hyperglycemia induction, with no differences in plasma lipoprotein cholesterol, arterial cholesterol, and atherosclerosis extent compared with the control group [59]. The increase in iron stores and arterial iron deposition might play a role in catalyzing the production of hydroxyl radicals from elevated arterial superoxide, resulting in accelerated diabetic vascular damage [59]. The overabundance of iron also possibly induces a marked pro- coagulant state via electrostatic interactions with fibrinogen and fibrin [60], aggregating diabetic cardiovascular injury. Iron overload also upregulates tissue factor released from endothelial cells, which is related to the initiation of coagulation cascade and vascular thrombosis, leading to hypercoagulable state and increased risk of thrombosis [61].  

## Susceptibility of diabetic heart to ferroptosis  

An increasing number of researches have been focusing on the susceptibility to ferroptosis in diabetic heart. Any cell in the biosphere containing iron, oxygen and PUFA- containing lipids may be at risk of undergoing ferroptosis [14]. The known pathophysiological changes in diabetic cardiovascular diseases, including excess oxidative stress, inflammation, AGE accumulation and impaired immune function possibly contribute to the vulnerability of ferroptosis (Fig. 2). And common comorbidities of diabetes such as obesity and metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) may also participate in the susceptibility to ferroptosis.   

Significantly increased systemic or cardiac inflammation is one of the main characteristics of diabetes mellitus, with increased proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1β), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and interleukin 18 (IL- 18) [62, 63]. Inflammatory cytokines, especially IL- 6, upregulate the expression of hepcidin and increase the level of intracellular ferritin [64]. Hepcidin suppresses iron export through ferroportin and intracellular ferritin accumulation induces ferritinophagy, together increasing intracellular labile iron contents [64]. IL- 6 also upregulates TfR expression and promotes iron

uptake [65]. Excess cellular iron, especially labile ferrous iron, can react with cellular oxidants and produce cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction, thus promoting ferroptosis [24].  

In the setting of diabetes mellitus, the production of ROS increases and endogenous antioxidant mechanisms are often impaired [8, 66, 67]. Abnormal lipid accumulation has also been observed in diabetic heart [8, 68, 69], promoting the production of ROS and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) [49]. Redundant ROS induces oxidative stress and consumes intracellular antioxidants, which further exacerbates lipid peroxidation in a vicious circle [70].  

AGEs significantly increase in the diabetic heart and activate AGE receptors [71, 72]. AGEs induce ferroptosis via increasing labile iron and suppressing the system Xc- /GSH/GPX4 pathway in murine- derived engineer cardiac tissue [73]. The interaction between AGEs and AGE receptors also amplifies the production of intracellular ROS [8, 74].  

In addition, macrophages are an essential component of the innate immune system, where iron homeostasis also plays a key role [75]. Macrophage activation is increased in diabetes and correlated with the onset and progression of cardiovascular complications [76, 77]. Macrophages can cause plaque rupture through ferroptosis, which may manifest as iron overload that promotes the transition of macrophages toward pro- inflammatory subtypes [78].  

Mitochondrial damage can also facilitate ferroptosis in diabetes [79, 80]. Iron overload also leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, with an evident decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiomyocytes [81, 82] and vascular endothelial cells [83], which is closely related to ferroptosis. The impaired mitochondrial membrane potential may be attributed to iron overload- induced excess ROS production in endothelial cells [61, 84]. Mitoferrin 2, an iron transporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane, was also found responsible for the mitochondrial membrane potential change in iron overload- induced endothelial cells [85]. Mitochondrial iron uptake is dependent on mitochondrial calcium uniporter, which plays a major role in mitochondrial dysfunction including mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ferroptosis under iron overload conditions in the heart [86- 88].  

Obesity, a common risk factor for diabetes, also contributes to abnormal myocardial iron accumulation [89, 90]. Obesity promotes the polarization of M1- type macrophages via increased secretion of adipokines from adipocytes, which aggregates iron accumulation through the production of inflammatory factors [91]. Excess IL- 6 in obesity activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), upregulating NCOA4 expression, which promotes ferritinophagy and leads to intracellular  

iron overload [92]. Rise of leptin level also elevates hepcidin which induces cellular retention of iron, possibly contributing to increased iron content in heart tissues in the context of obesity [93].  

MASLD is present in more than one- half of T2DM patients [94], probably also contributing to the ferroptosis- related mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diabetic CVDs. MASLD is associated with low- grade systemic inflammation, with increased release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- \(\alpha\) ), IL- 6 and IL- 1β [95, 96]. IL- 6 could activate STAT3, which promoted lipid peroxidation and suppressed GPX4, thus leading to cardiac ferroptosis [97]. IL- 1β induced ferroptosis in endothelial cells via p53- xCT- GSH axis [98]. In addition, MASLD is associated with ectopic fat deposition in the heart [95], probably promoting ferroptosis via increased oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory response [99]. Reduced adiponectin and elevated leptin levels are observed in individuals with MASLD [95], which possibly induces ferroptosis [100- 102].  

Taken together, it can be deduced from these factors that the diabetic heart is vulnerable to ferroptosis. The advent of ferroptosis has introduced a novel avenue within the realm of diabetic cardiovascular disease therapy.  

## Mechanism of ferroptosis in diabetes-related cardiovascular diseases  

Ferroptosis has been found implicated in cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, anthracycline cardiotoxicity, sepsis- induced cardiac injury and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [24, 25]. The oxidative stress, abnormal lipid metabolism and possibly iron overload status coexisted in diabetes may predispose the heart to ferroptosis. Here we summarized the potential mechanism of ferroptosis involved in diabetes- related cardiovascular diseases (Table 2).  

## Coronary artery disease  

Ferroptosis has been found involved in myocardial infarction [103]. And iron participates in the initiation, progression and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque via the oxidative modification of lipoproteins and its pro- inflammatory properties [104]. Although elevated iron levels have been found in the artery wall with atherosclerotic lesions compared with healthy controls [105, 106], the concentrations of iron were significantly lower in lesions from people with T2DM and hyperglycemia compared with non- DM [107], suggesting potentially different iron accumulation pattern of diabetes. However, Rowe et al. found iron deposits were more prevalent in


<!-- Page 6 -->

atherosclerotic segments of cynomologous monkeys with streptozotocin- induced diabetes [59]. Such discrepancy of iron contents in atherosclerosis lesions with different glucose metabolism status suggests the necessity of exploring the role of ferroptosis in diabetes- related atherosclerosis, since iron plays an important role in ferroptosis, and whether excess iron accumulation is the predisposing factor for ferroptosis in diabetes- related atherosclerosis remains uncertain.  

Vascular pathology in a T2DM atherosclerosis mice model revealed that diabetes induced vascular ferroptosis, which significantly contributed to diabetic atherosclerotic lesion formation. And HO- 1 played a pivotal role in the regulation of diabetes- induced ferroptosis in the endothelial injury [27]. High fat diet (HFD) or high glucose high lipid environment upregulated HO- 1, resulting in iron overload, ROS elevation, GPX4 and SLC7A11 downregulation, lipid peroxidation and collectively promoted endothelial cell ferroptosis [27]. Former study also provided evidence of pro- oxidant activity of HO- 1 in the diabetic heart, which was mediated by increased reductive iron [108]. However, HO- 1 degrades heme to iron, carbon monoxide and biliverdin, and the latter two have been considered to exert autoprotective and autodefensive function in stress conditions [109, 110]. An early study also found low level of HO- 1 determined by genotype increased the vulnerability of vasculature to oxidative injury and the incidence of CAD in diabetes [111]. Taken together, to what extent diabetic atherosclerosis is regulated by HO- 1 mediated ferroptosis still remains to be explored.  

## Heart failure  

Garvagi et al. discovered that diabetes could upregulate ferroptosis markers in human hearts with diabetic heart failure compared to healthy counterparts, with suppressed GPX4, influenced by downregulated activating transcription factor- 4, NRF2 and glutathione reductase [112]. This finding is consistent with former notions that NRF2 is involved in preventing the formation of lipid peroxides and the progression of the ferroptosis cascade [113]. NRF2 as a stress- inducible transcription factor, can translocate to the nucleus to initiate the transcription of antioxidant response element- containing genes, such as ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), ferroportin- 1 (FPN1), HO- 1, SLC7A11 and GPX4 [114]. However, another preclinical study discovered that NRF2 was upregulated in diabetes- induced heart failure mice. Overexpressing NRF2 aggravated heart failure and enhanced cardiac ferroptosis, with severe oxidative stress reaction and mitochondrial dysfunction, which might be related to the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC- 1α) signaling [115]. Therefore, the role of NRF2 in diabetic heart failure still warrants further  

evidence to elucidate. Additionally, diabetes upregulated LPCAT3 in patients with heart failure, facilitating the integration of PUFA into phospholipid membranes, and downregulated acyl- CoA thioesterase- 1 (ACOT1), which further promoted cardiac ferroptosis [112]. Sumneang et al. found that GPX4 was downregulated and LACS4 was upregulated in cardiac tissues of HFD- induced prediabetic rats, suggesting the possible implication of ferroptosis in prediabetic cardiac dysfunction [116].  

## Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury  

Several studies have confirmed ferroptosis is involved in diabetes- related myocardial I/R injury in rats [26, 117- 119]. In diabetic hearts stimulated by streptozotocin, decreased expression of GPX4 and increased level of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) were observed in myocardial I/R injury when compared with non- diabetic hearts. In vivo and in vitro experiments suggested involvement of ferroptosis in diabetic myocardial I/R injury might be regulated by NOX2- related oxidative stress in an AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK)- dependent manner [117]. Another study using streptozotocin- induced T1DM rats revealed that increased susceptibility to diabetes- related myocardial I/R injury was strongly associated with ferroptosis and disorders of iron metabolism, with downregulated FPN1 mediated by decreased NRF2 in diabetic I/R rats. Iron ions accumulation and imbalance of oxidative and antioxidant systems were also observed in rat hearts under diabetes and myocardial I/R conditions [119]. And the expression of LACS4 and GPX4 were changed during diabetic myocardial I/R injury [119].  

Ferritinophagy has been found involved in diabetic I/R injury. Li et al. observed the protein level of DMT1 and NCOA4 was increased and the level of FTH and GPX4 was decreased in the diabetic I/R group. Inhibition of DMT1 not only improved the left ventricular function and pathological changes, but also regulated the autophagy- ferroptosis axis in myocardial tissue. And inhibition of NCOA4 alleviated cardiomyocyte damage under high glucose hypoxia/reoxygenation [69]. Another study found a coupled pattern of ferroptosis and ERS in the setting of diabetic myocardial I/R injury, as in vitro and in vivo study indicated that inhibition of ferroptosis could reduce ERS and myocardial injury while inhibition of ERS could alleviate ferroptosis and cell injury [118].  

However, the increase of oxidative stress and ferroptosis was only observed in mature T2DM model but not at T2DM onset [30]. Huang et al. revealed an endogenous cardioprotective mechanism at T2DM onset in diabetic rats, which was related to down- regulated ferritinophagy/ferroptosis signaling [29]. Smaller post- ischemic myocardial infarct size was also found at the onset of

## Diabetic cardiomyopathy  

Diabetic cardiomyopathyDiabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), which was originally described as the occurrence of myocardial structural/functional abnormalities associated with diabetes in the absence of coronary heart disease, hypertension and/or obesity, recently referred to as diabetic myocardial disorder, is newly identified as systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction in the presence of diabetes [120]. Ferroptosis was found to participate in the development and progression of DCM [31, 73, 121, 122].  

Ferritinophagy mediated by NCOA4 is implicated in HFD- induced cardiac injury. Zhang et al. found that elevated (pro)renin receptor (PRR) led to ferroptosis- associated cardiac pathological changes via the NCOA4- mediated ferritinophagy pathway in diabetic cardiomyopathy [123]. Persistent hyperglycemic stimulation resulted in cardiomyocyte damage and activation of ferroptosis pathways, and then upregulated Pannexin- 1 to open ATP outflow channel, leading to an increase of extracellular ATP in db/db mouse. The increased ATP functioned as a paracrine molecule and combined to P2X7 receptors to activate ERK1/2, which regulated NCOA4- mediated ferritinophagy and HO- 1 expression [124]. Another study found that higher concentration of IL- 6 increased STAT3 phosphorylation, which positively regulated NCOA4- mediated ferritinophagy and ferroptosis, thus promoting cardiac injury in HFD- fed mice [92].  

Mitochondrial homeostasis acts as a critical role in endothelial ferroptosis in diabetes [80, 125]. Long- term high glucose/free fatty acid treatment triggered ferrous iron overload and lipid peroxide accumulation in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) [80]. Mitochondrial injury and mitophagy inhibition caused mitochondrial translocation of LACS4 and led to ferroptosis in endothelial cells [80]. Chen et al. found ferroptosis might be the downstream target of mitogen- activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4), the silencing of which significantly mitigated the myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction and cardiac ventricular remodeling in db/db mice. MAP4K4 promoted S- nitrosylation of Drp1 and its translocation to mitochondria in human CMECs by inhibiting GPX4 expression, thus stimulating endothelial ferroptosis in diabetes [126].  

NRF2 has been found to participate in the regulation of ferroptosis in diabetes [56, 73, 127, 128]. Tian et al. discovered that Rev- erba expression was decreased in DCM, and its knockdown aggravated DCM with significantly exacerbated iron metabolism disorders and subsequent ferroptosis, which was mediated by NRF2. This might be attributed to the reduced expression of NRF2 target genes such as FPN1, FTH1 and GPX4, which are related to decreased level of iron ions and increased lipid peroxidation [129]. However, NRF2 was also found to worsen diabetic cardiomyopathy via mechanism of ferroptosis. Zang et al. found T1DM overtime caused autophagy deficiency, which turned off NRF2- mediated defense while switching on an NRF2- operated pathological program toward ferroptosis with elevated LACS4 and repressed FSP1 expression in cardiomyocytes, thereby worsening the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy [56]. The dichotomous actions mediated by NRF2 are likely due to the potential dysfunction of NRF2- driven expression in diverse pathophysiological settings. And whether the pro- ferroptotic mechanism is specific to T1DM remains to be clarified.   

A series of enzymes were found implicated in the regulation of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of DCM. Increased level of ubiquitin- specific protease 24 (USP24) was observed in DCM, which subsequently triggered activation of NF- \(\kappa \mathrm{B}\) and initiated a cascade of molecular events. NF- \(\kappa \mathrm{B}\) downregulated the expression of SLC7A11, upregulated the expression of LACS4, and promoted the degradation of FTH1, collectively promoting lipid peroxidation and culminating in ferroptosis [130]. Zhen et al. discovered a novel lysine acetyltransferase 2 A (Kat2a)- ferroptosis axis in the pathogenesis of DCM. Increased level of Kat2a in high glucose- treated myocardial cells and cardiac tissues of DCM promoted epigenetic activation of TfR and HO- 1, thus facilitating the process of ferroptosis [131]. Wu et al. discovered cardiac retinol dehydrogenase 10 was downregulated in the hearts of mice and patients with T2DM, which disrupted the conversion of retinol to all- trans retinoic acid (atRA). As a result, the protective effect against myocardial injury mediated by the activation of retinoic acid receptors by atRA was impaired, leading to suppression of GPX4, FSP1 and FPN1 and upregulation of CD36, which contributed to ferroptosis and lipotoxicity respectively [132].  

In recent years, growing evidence has suggested that non- coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis, thus affecting CVD progression [133]. Several studies also explored the role of ncRNAs- mediated ferroptosis in DCM. A study discovered that long non- coding RNA ZFAS1(lncRNA- ZFAS1) was upregulated in mice with DCM and high glucose treated cardiomyocytes, and lncRNA- ZFAS1 could act as a competing endogenous RNA, to sponge miR- 150- 5p and suppress CCND2, which further promotes cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and DCM development [117]. High- fat diet caused upregulation of circ_005077, a circular RNA, in the myocardium. Circ_005077 could induce ferroptosis by interacting with Cyclophilin A and inhibiting its degradation via the ubiquitination proteasome system, thus promoting the interaction between Cyclophilin A and p47pbox

## Atrial fibrillation  

Limited studies have investigated the role of ferroptosis in diabetes- related atrial fibrillation (AF). Ferroptosis is likely to be involved in diabetic atrial fibrillation due to evidence of increased total iron and ferrous iron in diabetic atrial tissue. Antioxidant proteins such as GPX4, NRF2 and HO- 1 were also significantly reduced in diabetic atrial tissue in mice [28]. Ubiquitin- specific protease 38 (USP38), which belongs to the deubiquitinating enzymes family, can cleave ubiquitin from ubiquitin- modified proteins and inhibit protein degradation in the heart. It was found that overexpression of USP38 increased vulnerability to AF in diabetic mice. Xiao et al. found that the expression of USP38, was upregulated in atrial tissues of diabetic mice and HL- 1 cells exposed to high glucose. USP38 could bind to iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), stabilizing it and removing K48- linked polyubiquitination chains, leading to increasing intracellular iron overload, lipid peroxidation, and ultimately contribute to ferroptosis. Reduced iron overload by deferoxamine treatment alleviated oxidation stress and decreased vulnerability to AF in diabetic mice [28]. Future studies focusing on the mechanism of ferroptosis in diabetic AF may help discover more therapeutic options.  

## Therapeutic choices targeting ferroptosis for diabetes-related cardiovascular diseases  

Given its role in the pathogenesis of diabetes- related cardiovascular diseases, ferroptosis is a potentially promising therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic cardiovascular diseases. In this section, current evidence of pharmacological modulation of ferroptosis in diabetes- related cardiovascular diseases demonstrated in diverse preclinical animal models is discussed and summarized in Table 3.  

## Glucose-lowering medications in clinical practice Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors  

Sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are used in patients with T2DM as glucose- lowering therapies, with additional benefits of cardiac protection function [135]. The benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure patients with reduced or preserved ejection fraction are presented in patients irrespective of baseline glycemic status [136, 137]. Recent studies have corroborated that ferroptosis is implicated in the cardiac protective mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors.  

Asil et al. found that empagliflozin or dapagliflozin treatment at least for two months markedly raised the serum GPX4 levels and inhibited LACS4 levels in diabetic patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), providing evidence for the inhibition of ferroptosis in diabetic patients with HF [138]. A cross- sectional clinical trial observed that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors significantly increased either phosphatidyl ethanolamines containing either- linked oleic acid- 18:1_18:2 in epicardial adipose tissue of subjects with severe heart failure, suggesting a reduction of ferroptosis [139].   

Canagliflozin was observed to alleviate cardiac dysfunction of DCM by inhibiting ferroptosis. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that canagliflozin could inhibit the deposition of \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2 + }\) and total iron, which served as a key inducer of ferroptosis. In addition, the expression of FTH was suppressed and \(\mathrm{Xc}^{- }\) was up- regulated by canagliflozin, suggesting its potential role in the balance of cardiac iron metabolism and promoting the \(\mathrm{Xc}^{- }\) / GSH/GPX4 axis in DCM [121, 140]. It was also found that canagliflozin could attenuate lipotoxicity in cardiomyocytes by regulating inflammation and ferroptosis by activating the AMPK pathway [141].  

Dapagliflozin exerts cardioprotective effects independent of hypoglycemia. Chen et al. investigated the potential mechanism of dapagliflozin against myocardial I/R injury- related ferroptosis. Dapagliflozin significantly ameliorated myocardial injury, reperfusion arrhythmia, and cardiac function, via inhibition of ferroptosis by upregulating the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis and FTH and inhibiting LACS4, with mitigated oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and ferrous iron overload. Additionally, dapagliflozin treatment significantly reduced AMPK phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it may protect against myocardial I/R injury by reducing ferroptosis through the AMPK signaling pathway [142]. Wang et al. uncovered that dapagliflozin could reduce the levels of metabolite trimethylamine N- oxide synthesized by gut microbiota, thereby regulating ferroptosis- related target genes in diabetic I/R injury cardiomyocytes [143].  

Taken together, these findings imply that SGLT2 inhibitors can provide beneficial effects on diabetes with cardiovascular diseases via ameliorating ferroptosis.  

## Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 receptor agonists  

Glucagon- Like Peptide- 1 Receptor Agonists (GLP- 1 RAs) can reduce the rates of non- fatal myocardial infarction, non- fatal stroke and cardiovascular death, which has been verified in cardiovascular outcome trials in T2DM patients [144]. The regulatory effect of GLP- 1 RAs on ferroptosis has been verified in kidney [145- 147], liver [148, 149], skin [150] and hippocampus [151]. Similar inhibition of ferroptosis via GLP- 1 receptor stimulation has also been observed in cardiomyocytes [152]. Treatment with exendin- 4 (exenidate) alleviated myocardial

I/R injury and significantly reversed the elevated malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), the ratio of GSSG/GSH in the infarcted myocardium of I/R- induced rats [153], suggesting the possible implication of ferroptosis in the protective mechanism of GLP- 1 RAs on myocardium. Another study revealed that liraglutide significantly reduced the MDA, GSH and GPX4 in rat CMECs exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation [154], indicating GLP- 1 RAs protect CMECs by inhibiting ferroptosis.  

In addition, GLP- 1 RAs have been found to interact with NRF2 or HO- 1, which are closely related to the modulation of ferroptosis. Rizzo et al. found liraglutide could restore the plasma HO- 1 level in patients with T2DM [155]. Liraglutide could promote the NRF2 translocation and accumulation in the nucleus of aortic endothelial cells from HFD- fed rats to induce transcription of target genes [156], possibly containing the antioxidant response element or ferroptosis- related genes. GLP- 1 RAs were found to activate HO- 1 in endothelial cells [157, 158]. Liraglutide and exendin- 4 could increase the level of NRF2 and HO- 1 in hearts [159] or high glucose- induced cardiomyocytes [160]. Exendin- 4 also triggered NRF2 nuclear translocation and expressions of HO- 1 in the vascular smooth muscle cell, which was involved in its senescence prevention [161]. However, direct evidence of the GLP- 1 RA inhibiting ferroptosis via NRF2 accumulation in the nucleus was only found in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury [148]. The interaction of ferroptosis and NRF2 or HO- 1 modulated by GLP- 1 RAs should be further investigated in the cardiovascular system in the future.  

## Metformin  

Metformin has been recommended as the first- line treatment of hyperglycemia for patients with T2DM, and it should be considered if additional glucose control is needed on the basis of GLP- 1 RAs and/or SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease [3]. The effect of metformin on ferroptosis is dichotomous. Preclinical studies suggested that metformin could induce ferroptosis in renal parenchymal cells [162], breast cancer [163, 164] and hepatocellular carcinoma [165], while it could alleviate ferroptosis in chondrocytes [166], renal tubular epithelial cells [167], \(\beta\) - cells [168, 169], liver [170, 171] and the neural system [172, 173]. Metformin depicted an inhibitory effect on ferroptosis in cardiovascular systems in preclinical studies. Xu et al. discovered that metformin could inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating NRF2, alleviating the HFD- induced myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction [174]. Metformin alleviated hyperlipidemia- associated vascular calcification through anti- ferroptotic effect, via regulating SLC7A11, which is p53- dependent [175]. Metformin also increased the expression and nuclear translocation  

of NRF2 and its downstream target gene NQO1, which was possibly related to inhibiting lipid peroxidation [175]. It was also found that metformin improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac ferroptosis in myocardial I/R injury, with the mechanism of reducing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) via promoting AMPKα [176]. Metformin could alleviate doxorubicin- induced cardiotoxicity by targeting AMPKα2, which inhibited lipid peroxidation- associated ferroptosis [177]. In conclusion, metformin may exert protective effects on the cardiovascular system by inhibiting ferroptosis. However, whether similar effects of inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells of metformin exist in the cardiovascular system should be cautiously investigated in future studies.  

## Potential therapeutic choices in preclinical studies Coronary artery diseases  

Potential therapeutic choices in preclinical studies Coronary artery diseasesAlthough ferroptosis has been found involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic atherosclerosis, evidence of therapeutic choices targeting ferroptosis in diabetic atherosclerosis is limited. The ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin- 1, effectively attenuated diabetic atherosclerosis and mitigated HFD- induced lipid metabolism disorder in diabetic mice with atherosclerosis, without affecting the glucose status [27]. Hydroxyasafflor yellow A (HSYA) was found to reduce diabetic atherosclerosis plaque in mice by effectively reducing oxidative stress and ferroptosis in aortic tissues. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in high glucose high lipid environment, HSYA downregulated miR- 429, the suppression of which upregulated SLC7A11, thus inhibiting ferroptosis [178]. Yang et al. discovered that dietary capsaicin, a natural compound present in chili peppers, significantly improved post- myocardial infarction cardiac function and attenuated myocardial inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting ferroptosis in T2DM mice models. It was found that dietary capsaicin could reduce ferroptosis levels by activating myocardial transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1, upregulating NRF2 expression and nuclear translocation and increasing the expression of HO- 1 [179]. Another preclinical study discovered adding 2mmol/L N- acetylcysteine in drinking water for 1 week or 4 weeks reduced the myocardial infarct size in T1DM mice, which can be attributed to the reduction of ferroptosis at the corresponding time [58].  

## Heart failure  

Heart failureRecently, novel therapeutic choices for heart failure in diabetes targeting ferroptosis pathways were discovered. In a mouse heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) model with impaired glucose tolerance, imagining, a potential new treatment for T2DM, was found not only to improve abnormal systemic glucose metabolism but also prevent the development of heart failure. In

addition to the suppression of iNOS and FoxO1, meglimin also restored the expression of GPX4, thus protecting cells against excess lipid peroxidation and suppressing ferroptosis [180]. However, the effect of meglimin on HFpEF in diabetes still awaits further clinical trials.  

## Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury  

Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injuryFerroptosis- related pathways provide potential targets for therapy of diabetic myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. The use of ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostain- 1 alleviated myocardial I/R injury and improved cardiac function in diabetic rats [30, 118]. Nobletin inhibited NCOA4 and LACS4, and also suppressed Rev- erba, alleviating myocardial I/R injury and limiting ferroptosis in T2DM [26, 30]. Zhou et al. found that Propofol and salvianolic acid A upregulated the expression of GPX4 and downregulated the expression of CD36 induced by high fatty acids, further increased p- AMPK, and reduced lipid peroxidation, thus alleviating ferroptosis and diabetic myocardial I/R injury [181]. And activation of NRF2, which controls the transcription of FPN1, by its activator sulforaphane could alleviate diabetic myocardial I/R injury by inhibition of ferroptosis [119]. Another preclinical study discovered adding 2mmol/L N- acetylcysteine in drinking water for 4 weeks conferred the most profound protection against myocardial I/R injury, with significantly ameliorated iron infiltration and higher GPX4, SLC7A11 and ferritin levels, while N- acetylcysteine protected the heart through its antioxidant capacity rather than or to a much less degree through anti- ferroptosis [58]. However, further work is still warranted to thoroughly understand the mechanism of myocardial ferroptosis in diabetes and to explore relevant potential clinical implications.  

## Diabetic cardiomyopathy  

Ferroptosis is an important mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, and inhibition of ferroptosis by liproxstatin- 1 alleviated cardiac diastolic dysfunction at 3 months after the onset of diabetes, which suggests targeting ferroptosis can provide a potential therapeutic choice for DCM [73].  

A series of studies have explored targeting NRF2 as a therapeutic target for DCM via regulating ferroptosis in preclinical studies. Wang et al. discovered that sulforaphane could promote the nuclear accumulation of NRF2 via AMPK activation, up- regulating the expression of SLC7A11 and ferritin inhibited by AGEs in mice with diabetic cardiomyopathy, which shields cardiomyocytes from ferroptosis. These findings suggested sulforaphane in combination with low- dose iron chelators such as deferasirox and deferiprone might be a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention of DCM [73]. Wu et al. found 6- gingerol could ameliorate cardiac injury in mouse model of DCM. 6- gingerol not only inhibited  

the expression of LACS4, reduced iron overload, and upregulated the expression of GPX4, but also suppressed inflammation via enhancing NRF2/HO- 1 pathway [127]. Wei et al. also found that curcumin promoted nucleus translocation of NRF2, which further increased the expression of HO- 1, reduced cardiomyocyte accumulation of intracellular oxides, alleviated GPX4 depletion, thus inhibiting the progression of glucose- induced ferroptosis and improved myocardial structure in diabetes [128]. Wang et al. explored the potential mechanism of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) of alleviating cardiac damage in DCM. They discovered that H2S could promote E3 ligase synoviolin(Syvn1)- Keap1 interaction and subsequently regulate NRF2/GPX4/GSH pathway to reduce ferroptosis and mitochondrial apoptosis in DCM, shedding light on the potential therapeutic implication of H2S in DCM [182]. And supplementation of irisin alleviated cardiac remodeling and dysfunction via Sirtuin 1- mediated deacetylation of p53, which suppressed ferroptosis with elevated expression of SLC7A11/GPX4 [31].  

Several studies also explored the efficiency of plant extracts in the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy and its mechanism related to iron hemostasis and ferroptosis. Li et al. found that Astragaloside IV could inhibit CD36 expression and decrease cellular lipid deposition, MDA, and lipid ROS production, as well as downregulate p53 and LACS4, upregulate GPX4, and suppress cellular ferroptosis, thus ameliorating cardiomyocyte injury and myocardial dysfunction in DCM rats [183]. Wu et al. discovered that paeoniflorin could exert protective effects on diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice, via inhibiting ferroptosis and ameliorating intestinal microbiota environment, and 11,12- epoxyeicosatrienoic acid served as a crucial part in the cardioprotective and anti- ferroptotic effects of paeoniflorin treatment [184]. Baicalin was found to have cardioprotective effects on DCM. Baicalin inhibited cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and apoptosis via promoting desmall ubiquitin- like modifier (deSUMOylation) of Sirtuin 3 by Sentrin/SUMO- specific protease 1 (SENP1), restoring mitochondrial stability and preventing the cell death of cardiomyocytes [185]. Piperlongumine, could inhibit STAT3 upregulated by increased IL- 6. The inhibition of STAT3 then suppressed the NCOA4- mediated ferritin- ophagy and ferroptosis in high- fat- diet fed mice, thus alleviating cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in HFd- fed mice [92].  

## Discussion  

Cardiovascular diseases represent the principal cause of death and comorbidity among people with diabetes [186]. A thorough understanding of the pathological changes and molecular mechanisms related to diabetic CVDs is crucial for the development of disease prevention and control strategies. Current studies have verified

that ferroptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes- related cardiovascular diseases. And ferroptosis inhibitors can alleviate diabetic cardiac injury and slow its progression by inhibiting ferroptosis. However, research on the role of ferroptosis in diabetic CVDs is relatively limited, and there are still many problems remaining to be clarified.  

Although a few studies have observed abnormal iron accumulation in diabetic heart in patients and animal models [31, 49, 52, 54- 56], current evidence is relatively limited to reach a robust conclusion. More studies using cardiac MRI to evaluate myocardium iron content in diabetic patients can help illustrate the association of myocardium iron and glycaemia, and whether the myocardium iron changes with the progression of diabetes or heart function. Future preclinical research may help dig into novel intrinsic mechanisms linking glycemia and myocardium iron content. Additionally, although abnormal lipid accumulation has been observed in diabetic heart [8, 68, 69], whether such lipid accumulation serves as a trigger or inhibitor of ferroptosis remains uncertain, since the formation of lipid droplets can separate PUFA from membrane phospholipids, which may limit the execution of ferroptosis [187]. Therefore, the change of lipid composition in cellular membrane and cytoplasm in high- glucose condition and its relationship with ferroptosis can be explored in the future.  

Several studies have investigated the involvement of NRF2 and HO- 1 in ferroptosis- related pathways, it should be noticed that they are also known as an endogenous anti- oxidative factor and not specific to ferroptosis [188]. Current studies on both NRF2 and HO- 1 in the regulation of diabetic CVDs seem to be dichotomous, and more research may help to explore the regulatory mechanism of NRF2 and HO- 1 in ferroptosis and reconsider their role as therapeutic targets.  

Prediabetes shares similar but mild hyperglycemia and oxidative stress with diabetes, and studies exploring the role of ferroptosis in prediabetic hearts are scarce. Some studies also observed protective function against ferroptosis at the onset of diabetes. Further preclinical research is required to provide more evidence for the role of ferroptosis in prediabetic heart, so that more appropriate intervention strategies can be discovered. And suitable biomarkers identified to reflect the severity of ferroptosis under different hyperglycemia conditions may deepen our insights into the influence of high glucose environment on ferroptosis.  

In addition, since diabetes is a chronic condition and inducing ferroptosis has been implicated in cancer therapy, whether long- term inhibition of ferroptosis for treating diabetic cardiovascular diseases increases the cancer risk remains largely unknown. Therefore, more preclinical studies are warranted to cautiously evaluate the long- term safety and the impact of ferroptosis- targeting therapy on other organs or systems before further clinical applications.   

## Conclusion  

In conclusion, this review summarizes the role of ferroptosis in diabetes- related CVDs and potential therapeutic choices targeting ferroptosis- related pathways. Further study on the regulatory mechanism and signaling pathways of ferroptosis and how diabetes renders the heart to ferroptosis can improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes- related CVDs and provide more potential therapeutic options.
